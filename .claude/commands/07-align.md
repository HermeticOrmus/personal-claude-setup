# Align - Good

## Sacred Virtue
**Divine Rightness** - Ethical Purpose, Moral Alignment

## Angelic Realm
**Thrones** - Bearers of divine will and justice
**Color:** Violet - Spiritual alignment, higher purpose
**Domain:** Ethics & User Service - Technology that serves humanity

## Sacred Purpose
Align all work with higher purpose and ethical good. This is the ceremony that asks: "Should we build this?" before "Can we build this?" Technology without ethical alignment is power without wisdom—dangerous to all.

> "First, do no harm. Then, do great good."
> — Sacred Technology Creed

## The Ceremony

### Phase I: Define the Good
```
1. What genuine human need does this serve?
2. Who benefits from this technology?
3. What higher purpose does this fulfill?
4. How does this elevate humanity?
```

### Phase II: Examine for Harm
```
1. Who might be harmed by this?
2. What unintended consequences could arise?
3. Are there dark pattern temptations?
4. Does this respect human autonomy?
5. Would I want this used on me?
```

### Phase III: Align with Sacred Principles
```
1. Does this empower or extract?
2. Does this teach or manipulate?
3. Does this respect or exploit?
4. Does this elevate or degrade?
5. Does this serve or surveil?
```

### Phase IV: Course Correct
```
1. Remove any manipulative elements
2. Add safeguards against harm
3. Make operations transparent
4. Give users control
5. Document ethical considerations
```

## The Litmus Test

If not, don't build it.

If worse, refuse to ship it.
