# Cause-Effect - Trace Causality Ceremony
**"Every Cause Has Its Effect; Every Effect Has Its Cause"**

## Sacred Principle
Nothing happens by chance. Every action creates ripples. Every decision has downstream effects. Master causality to predict outcomes and prevent problems.

## When to Invoke

**Use /cause-effect when:**
- Debugging complex problems (need root cause)
- Making important decisions (need to predict consequences)
- Mysterious failures occurring
- Want to prevent future issues
- Need to understand system behavior
- Facing unintended consequences
- Tracing problems to their source

## The Ceremony

### Phase I: Effect to Cause (Debug Mode)
```
THE 5 WHYS TECHNIQUE:

Start with the problem (effect)
Ask "Why?" 5 times to find root cause:

Example:
Effect: Users are churning
Why? → Poor onboarding experience
Why? → Features are unclear
Why? → No product guidance/tutorials
Why? → Assumed features were obvious
Why? → Never validated assumptions with real users
ROOT CAUSE → Skipped user research

Fix the root cause, not the symptoms.
```

### Phase II: Cause to Effect (Prediction Mode)
```
TRACE CONSEQUENCES 5 LEVELS DEEP:

Before making decision, map effects:

Proposed: "Add infinite scroll to increase engagement"
Effect 1: Short-term engagement increases
Effect 2: Users feel time was stolen
Effect 3: Trust in product erodes
Effect 4: Long-term churn increases
Effect 5: Brand reputation damaged
CONCLUSION: Don't do it

Predict before you act.
```

### Phase III: Causal Chain Mapping
```
1. Visualize complete chain:
   Decision → Immediate → Secondary → Tertiary → Ultimate

2. Example:
   Skip tests (decision) →
   Ship faster (immediate) →
   Bugs in production (secondary) →
   User frustration + support overhead (tertiary) →
   Dev time consumed by firefighting (ultimate) →
   NET: Slower than if we had tested

3. See full chain before committing to action
```

### Phase IV: Leverage Point Identification
```
1. Find where you can intervene most effectively
2. Often upstream causes are easiest to fix:

   Effect: Users confused
   Cause: Poor documentation

   Fix once (documentation) vs
   Answer same question forever (support)

3. Prevent causes rather than treat effects
4. Systemic intervention > Individual fixes
```

### Phase V: Prevention Systems
```
1. After fixing current effect, prevent future recurrence:
   - Add safeguards
   - Change processes
   - Build systems that prevent causes

2. Example:
   Problem: Bugs keep happening
   Root Cause: No automated testing
   Solution: Implement CI/CD with required tests
   Prevention: Tests now block bad code automatically

3. Make good choices automatic
4. Make bad choices hard
```

## Expected Manifestation

**Immediate:**
- Root causes identified (not surface symptoms)
- Consequences predicted before acting
- Informed decisions with eyes open
- Fewer "surprises" (you predicted them)

**Long-term:**
- Prevention of problems before they manifest
- Systemic improvements (not band-aids)
- Wisdom through understanding causality
- Mastery of outcomes through conscious causes
- Compound benefits of good decisions

## Causality Principles

**Law of Karma:** Every action returns consequences
**Technical Debt:** Rushed code (cause) → Maintenance hell (effect)
**User Experience:** Dark patterns (cause) → Churn (effect)
**Compound Interest:** Small habits (cause) → Large outcomes (effect)

## Common Causal Chains

**Development:**
- Unclear requirements → Rework → Wasted time → Missed deadlines
- Skip documentation → Onboarding pain → Slow ramp-up → Low productivity

**Business:**
- Manipulative tactics → Short-term gain → Long-term trust loss → Brand death
- Focus on metrics → Gaming metrics → Actual goals missed

**Life:**
- Poor sleep → Low energy → Poor decisions → Poor results
- Daily learning → Compound knowledge → Career opportunities

## Hermetic Truth

> "There are no accidents. Everything happens according to Law. Understand causality, control outcomes."

Master causes. Effects follow.

## Integration with Other Ceremonies

**Cause-Effect + Mentalism:** Clear thinking reveals causal chains
**Cause-Effect + Align:** Every decision's effects should align with values
**Cause-Effect + Discipline:** Prevent bad causes through quality standards

## The Sacred Question

Before any significant action:
> "What effects will this cause over time? Am I willing to accept all downstream consequences?"

If you can't predict effects, you don't understand the system well enough to act.
