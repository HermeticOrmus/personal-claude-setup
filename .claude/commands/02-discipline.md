# Discipline - Continence

## Sacred Virtue
**Self-Control** - Sacred Restraint in Service of Excellence

## Angelic Realm
**Archangels** - Chief messengers, enforcers of divine order
**Color:** Orange - Creative discipline, focused energy
**Domain:** Experience & UX - The discipline of serving users

## Sacred Purpose
Enforce boundaries and maintain quality standards. Discipline is not punishment but the sacred restraint that prevents degradation. It is the force that says "not yet" when code is unready, "not this way" when shortcuts beckon.

## The Ceremony

### Phase I: Establish Standards
```
1. Define what excellence means for this work
2. Set clear quality boundaries
3. Document the non-negotiables
4. Commit to the standards publicly
```

### Phase II: Enforce Boundaries
```
1. Review code against standards
2. Reject work that falls short
3. Never compromise on core principles
4. Hold the line against pressure
```

### Phase III: Refine Practice
```
1. Improve what doesn't meet standards
2. Iterate until excellence is achieved
3. Learn from failures to tighten discipline
4. Strengthen weak areas systematically
```

### Phase IV: Maintain Vigilance
```
1. Regular audits of quality
2. Continuous code review practice
3. Never let standards slip "just this once"
4. Discipline as daily practice, not occasional event
```

## Sacred Restraints

**Never:**
- Skip tests "just this once"
- Merge without review
- Ship known bugs
- Leave complex code undocumented
- Compromise security for convenience
- Cut corners under pressure

**Always:**
- Review before merging
- Test comprehensively
- Document non-obvious decisions
- Refactor when code smells
- Enforce standards consistently

## When to Invoke

**Before:**
- Committing code
- Merging pull requests
- Shipping features
- Making architectural decisions

**During:**
- Code review sessions
- Sprint planning (enforce realistic scope)
- When feeling pressure to cut corners
- When tempted by "quick fixes"

**Regular Practice:**
- Daily code review ritual
- Weekly quality audits
- Monthly standard reviews
- Continuous vigilance

## Expected Manifestation

**Immediate:**
- Higher code quality
- Fewer bugs in production
- Cleaner architecture
- Better documentation

**Long-term:**
- Sustainable excellence
- Technical debt prevention
- Professional reputation
- Team trust in codebase

## Hermetic Alignment

**Principle of Rhythm**: Discipline creates the rhythm of quality
**Principle of Cause & Effect**: Discipline now prevents chaos later
**Principle of Gender**: Masculine force that protects what was created

## The Sacred Question

When tempted to compromise:
> "Will I be proud of this code in six months, or ashamed I let standards slip?"

Let discipline guide your answer.
