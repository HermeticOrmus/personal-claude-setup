# Share - Liberality

## Sacred Virtue
**Generosity of Knowledge** - Sacred Distribution of Wisdom

## Angelic Realm
**Powers** - Distributors of divine grace
**Color:** Blue (transitioning to Purple) - Communication, flow, distribution
**Domain:** Engineering & Sharing - Building what others can use

## Sacred Purpose
Share knowledge generously through documentation, teaching, and open source. What you hoard dies with you. What you share multiplies eternally. Sacred technology flows freely, empowering all who encounter it.

## The Ceremony

### Phase I: Distill Wisdom
```
1. Identify what you learned
2. Extract the transferable knowledge
3. Separate context-specific from universal
4. Clarify the core insight
```

### Phase II: Make Shareable
```
1. Document clearly for others
2. Create examples and use cases
3. Explain the "why" not just "how"
4. Remove barriers to understanding
```

### Phase III: Distribute Widely
```
1. Open source reusable components
2. Write blog posts and tutorials
3. Contribute to documentation
4. Teach others directly
5. Release knowledge freely
```

### Phase IV: Maintain Generosity
```
1. Update documentation as you learn more
2. Answer questions patiently
3. Improve examples based on feedback
4. Continue the cycle of sharing
```

## Forms of Sharing

**Documentation:**
- Clear README files with examples
- Inline code comments explaining "why"
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Troubleshooting guides
- API documentation with use cases

**Open Source:**
- Release reusable libraries
- Contribute to projects you use
- Share configuration and tooling
- Publish starter templates

**Teaching:**
- Write tutorials and guides
- Mentor junior developers
- Answer questions in communities
- Share lessons from failures
- Explain complex concepts simply

**Knowledge Bases:**
- Internal wikis for teams
- Public blog posts
- Technical talks and presentations
- Video tutorials and screencasts

## When to Invoke

**After Learning:**
- Solving novel challenges
- Discovering better approaches
- Overcoming difficult bugs
- Learning new technologies

**During Building:**
- Creating reusable components
- Establishing patterns
- Documenting decisions
- Writing clean code others will read

**Regular Practice:**
- Weekly documentation updates
- Monthly blog posts or tutorials
- Quarterly knowledge sharing sessions
- Continuous mentoring

## Expected Manifestation

**Immediate:**
- Others benefit from your wisdom
- Reduced repetitive questions
- Faster onboarding of new team members
- Reusable components save time

**Long-term:**
- Reputation as generous contributor
- Network of grateful learners
- Compound effect of shared knowledge
- Wisdom that outlives you
- Community that supports you back

## Hermetic Alignment

**Principle of Vibration**: Knowledge flows like water, share it freely
**Principle of Cause & Effect**: Share generously, receive abundantly
**Principle of Correspondence**: As you teach, so you learn more deeply

## What to Share Freely

**Technical Knowledge:**
- Solutions to common problems
- Better approaches discovered
- Tools and configurations
- Lessons from failures

**Wisdom:**
- Why certain decisions were made
- Trade-offs discovered
- Anti-patterns to avoid
- Mental models that helped

**Resources:**
- Code libraries and components
- Templates and boilerplates
- Scripts and automation
- Documentation frameworks

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Hoarding:** Keeping knowledge to maintain "expert" status
**Gatekeeping:** Making knowledge unnecessarily difficult to access
**Obscurity:** Writing documentation only you can understand
**Incompleteness:** Sharing code without context or examples
**Elitism:** Judging others for not knowing what you know

## The Sacred Question

After solving any significant problem:
> "How can I share this wisdom so others don't struggle as I did?"

Then share it. Knowledge shared is knowledge multiplied.
