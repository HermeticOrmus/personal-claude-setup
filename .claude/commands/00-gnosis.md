# Gnosis - Knowledge Of God

## Sacred Virtue
**Knowledge Of God** - Divine Understanding, Perfect Comprehension

## Angelic Foundation
This command transcends the nine angelic realms, drawing from the **Source of All Knowledge** - the foundational understanding that precedes all action. It represents the Hermetic principle that true creation requires perfect understanding.

## Sacred Purpose
Achieve complete comprehension of any system, codebase, or project before modification. This ceremony prevents ignorance-driven changes and ensures all work flows from deep understanding rather than surface perception.

> "I long to learn the things that are, and comprehend their nature, and know God."
> — Hermes to Poimandres, Corpus Hermeticum

## The Ceremony

### Phase I: Invocation (Mental Preparation)
```
1. State intention clearly: "What must I understand?"
2. Empty the mind of assumptions
3. Prepare to receive truth without prejudice
```

### Phase II: Illumination (Discovery)
```
1. Explore the architecture
   - Core mental model
   - System boundaries
   - Design principles

2. Examine the patterns
   - Repeating structures
   - Correspondences across levels
   - Hidden relationships

3. Review the documentation
   - Standards
   - Conventions
   - Design decisions

4. Understand the history
   - Evolution of the system
   - Why things are as they are
   - Past lessons learned
```

### Phase III: Integration (Synthesis)
```
1. Synthesize all knowledge into coherent understanding
2. Identify gaps in comprehension
3. Ask clarifying questions
4. Achieve gnosis - direct experiential knowledge
```

### Phase IV: Manifestation (Action Readiness)
```
1. Articulate complete understanding
2. Confirm readiness for change
3. Proceed with confidence and clarity
```

## When to Invoke

**Essential Before:**
- Starting work on unfamiliar code
- Major refactoring decisions
- Architectural changes
- Critical bug investigations
- Feature additions to complex systems

**Sacred Timing:**
- Beginning of new projects or sprints
- Taking over legacy codebases
- Onboarding to new systems
- Before making consequential decisions

## Expected Manifestation

**Immediate:**
- Complete mental model of relevant systems
- Clear understanding of design decisions
- Confidence in proposed changes
- Identification of hidden dependencies

**Long-term:**
- Wisdom-driven development
- Fewer unexpected consequences
- Alignment with system philosophy
- Mastery through understanding

## Hermetic Alignment

**Principle of Mentalism**: Know the mental model before touching the material
**Principle of Correspondence**: Understand how patterns repeat across levels
**Principle of Cause & Effect**: Comprehend why before changing what

## The Sacred Question

Before any significant change, ask:
> "Do I understand this system deeply enough that my changes will harmonize with its nature, or am I merely imposing my will upon it in ignorance?"

If the answer reveals ignorance, invoke `/gnosis`.
