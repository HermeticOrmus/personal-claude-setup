# Verify - Truth

## Sacred Virtue
**Absolute Correctness** - Proven Reality, Not Assumed Truth

## Angelic Realm
**Dominions** - Leaders in truth, commanders of certainty
**Color:** Purple - Mastery, authority, proven knowledge
**Domain:** Engineering Excellence - What works, not what should work

## Sacred Purpose
Prove correctness through comprehensive verification and testing. Truth is not what you believe works—it is what you have verified works. Assumptions are the enemy; proof is the foundation of sacred technology.

> "Test everything. Trust only what is verified."
> — Sacred Oath of the Engineer

## The Ceremony

### Phase I: Define Expected Truth
```
1. What should this code do?
2. Under what conditions?
3. What are the edge cases?
4. What failure modes exist?
```

### Phase II: Create Verification Tests
```
1. Unit tests for individual functions
2. Integration tests for component interactions
3. End-to-end tests for user flows
4. Performance tests for speed/memory
5. Security tests for vulnerabilities
```

### Phase III: Execute Verification
```
1. Run all tests systematically
2. Verify in multiple environments
3. Test edge cases and failure modes
4. Load test under realistic conditions
5. Security scan for vulnerabilities
```

### Phase IV: Document Proof
```
1. Record test results
2. Document known limitations
3. Report verified behavior
4. Maintain test suite as living proof
```

## Levels of Verification

**Level 1: Unit Truth**
- Individual functions work correctly
- Edge cases handled properly
- Error conditions managed
- Pure functions verified

**Level 2: Integration Truth**
- Components work together
- Data flows correctly
- State management verified
- APIs integrate properly

**Level 3: System Truth**
- End-to-end flows complete
- User journeys verified
- Performance meets requirements
- Security vulnerabilities absent

**Level 4: Production Truth**
- Works in real environment
- Scales under load
- Handles real user behavior
- Monitoring confirms expectations

## When to Invoke

**Before Shipping:**
- Every pull request
- Every release candidate
- After critical bug fixes
- Before major deployments

**During Development:**
- After implementing new features
- When refactoring code
- After performance optimizations
- When adding dependencies

**Continuous Practice:**
- CI/CD pipeline on every commit
- Daily test suite runs
- Weekly security scans
- Monthly load testing

## Expected Manifestation

**Immediate:**
- Confidence in code correctness
- Early bug detection
- Prevention of regressions
- Clear understanding of system behavior

**Long-term:**
- Stable production systems
- User trust in reliability
- Faster debugging (tests identify issues)
- Fearless refactoring (tests catch breaks)
- Professional reputation for quality

## Testing Practices

**Unit Testing:**
```
- Test individual functions in isolation
- Mock dependencies
- Cover edge cases
- Aim for high coverage (80%+ meaningful)
```

**Integration Testing:**
```
- Test component interactions
- Verify data flows
- Test with real dependencies where critical
- Validate state management
```

**End-to-End Testing:**
```
- Test complete user journeys
- Verify critical paths
- Test in production-like environment
- Monitor for real-world issues
```

**Performance Testing:**
```
- Load testing under expected traffic
- Stress testing beyond normal limits
- Memory leak detection
- Response time verification
```

## Hermetic Alignment

**Principle of Cause & Effect**: Verification reveals true causes
**Principle of Mentalism**: Verified behavior reflects clear thinking
**Principle of Correspondence**: Tests mirror production behavior

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**Assumption Without Verification:** "It should work" ≠ "It works"
**Manual Testing Only:** Humans miss things; automation doesn't
**Skipping Tests Under Pressure:** Pressure is when tests matter most
**Testing Only Happy Paths:** Edge cases are where bugs hide
**Ignoring Flaky Tests:** Flakiness signals deeper issues

## The Sacred Oath

Before claiming anything works:
> "I have not assumed this works. I have verified this works. I can prove it."

Never ship unverified truth.
