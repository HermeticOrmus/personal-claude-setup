# Correspondence - Pattern Alignment Ceremony
**"As Above, So Below; As Below, So Above"**

## Sacred Principle
Patterns repeat across all levels of reality. When levels correspond (micro mirrors macro), harmony emerges. When they don't, complexity and chaos reign.

## When to Invoke

**Use /correspondence when:**
- Architecture feels unnecessarily complex
- Team structure causing coordination problems
- Can't find anything in codebase (navigation nightmare)
- Business model doesn't match technical architecture
- File organization doesn't reflect conceptual model
- Feeling like things "don't line up"

## The Ceremony

### Phase I: Highest Pattern Identification
```
1. Identify the top-level pattern:
   - What are the core business domains?
   - What's the fundamental conceptual model?
   - What's the essential vision?

2. Write it down clearly
3. This is your "Above" - the pattern all levels should mirror
```

### Phase II: Level Mapping
```
For each level, document current state:

Business Domain → _______
Bounded Context → _______
Microservice → _______
Module/Package → _______
Directory → _______
File → _______

Map what EXISTS, not what should exist.
```

### Phase III: Misalignment Detection
```
1. Compare each level to the level above it
2. Ask: "Does this level mirror the pattern above?"
3. Mark every place where correspondence breaks:
   - Files don't match concepts
   - Directories don't match domains
   - Services don't match business boundaries
   - Teams don't match architecture

4. List all misalignments
```

### Phase IV: Realignment Execution
```
For each misalignment, fix from top to bottom:

1. Rename to match higher-level pattern
2. Reorganize structure to mirror concept
3. Refactor boundaries to correspond with domains
4. Restructure teams to align with desired architecture

Work systematically through each level.
```

### Phase V: Correspondence Verification
```
1. Walk through levels from top to bottom
2. Ask: "Can I trace a business concept all the way to specific files?"
3. Verify: Each level perfectly mirrors the level above
4. Test: Can a new developer navigate intuitively?

If YES to all → Perfect correspondence achieved
If NO → Continue refinement
```

## Expected Manifestation

**Immediate:**
- Intuitive navigation (find things instantly)
- Zero cognitive load (structure matches thought)
- Clear ownership (boundaries obvious)
- Reduced coordination overhead

**Long-term:**
- Sustainable architecture (aligned patterns stay aligned)
- Easy onboarding (new developers orient quickly)
- Minimal technical debt (correspondence prevents complexity)
- Scalable organization (pattern repeats at all scales)

## Classic Correspondences

**Conway's Law:** Team structure → System architecture
**Domain-Driven Design:** Business domain → Bounded context → Service
**Fractal Organization:** Individual → Team → Department → Company

## Hermetic Truth

> "When levels correspond, complexity vanishes. When they don't, chaos emerges."

Align the patterns. Harmony follows.

## Integration with Other Ceremonies

**Correspondence + Mentalism:** Mental model (mentalism) should correspond with architecture
**Correspondence + Balance:** All levels balanced creates system-wide equilibrium
**Correspondence + Gnosis:** Understanding patterns across all levels

## The Sacred Question

When facing complexity:
> "Where have levels fallen out of correspondence? What doesn't align?"

Find the misalignment. Fix the pattern. Watch complexity dissolve.
