# Apply Metalearning

**Master**: Scott Young
**Core Principle**: "Learn HOW to learn it before learning it. 10% research = 90% efficiency."
**Time**: 10% of total learning time (upfront)
**Best For**: Starting completely new skills, planning learning approach, efficiency

---

## The Metalearning Insight

**Most people**:
1. Jump straight into learning
2. Use inefficient methods
3. Waste 90% of effort on low-value activities
4. Quit when progress stalls

**Metalearning approach**:
1. Research HOW to learn it (10% of time)
2. Identify highest-value activities
3. Design focused practice
4. Learn 10x faster

**Example**: Before learning Spanish, spend 10 hours researching:
- What methods work fastest?
- What's the 20% of vocabulary that covers 80% of conversations?
- Should I focus on speaking, reading, or both?
- What mistakes do learners make?
- Who learned Spanish fastest, and how?

Then spend 90 hours executing the plan.

## When to Use This Skill

✅ **Use when:**
- Starting completely new skill
- Previous learning attempts failed
- Have limited time (need efficiency)
- Large time investment planned (months/years)
- Unclear what to practice
- Multiple learning paths available

❌ **Don't use when:**
- Already know how to learn this type of skill
- Time-pressured (just start)
- Very simple skill (overkill)
- Skill is extremely new (no proven methods yet)

## The 3-Part Metalearning Map

Scott Young's framework breaks learning into 3 questions:

### 1. WHY? (Motivation & Goal)
- Why am I learning this?
- What's my end goal?
- What level of mastery do I need?
- What's success look like?

### 2. WHAT? (Concepts, Facts, Procedures)
- What concepts must I understand?
- What facts must I memorize?
- What procedures must I practice?

### 3. HOW? (Methods & Resources)
- How do experts learn this?
- What methods work best?
- What resources are highest quality?
- What's the fastest path?

## The 10-Hour Metalearning Process

### Hour 1-2: Define "Why" and Success Criteria

**Activities**:
1. Write specific end goal (not "learn X" but "build Y using X")
2. Set success criteria (measurable)
3. Define time commitment (realistic)
4. Identify motivations (intrinsic vs extrinsic)

**Questions**:
- Why specifically am I learning this?
- What will I build/do with this skill?
- What's good enough vs mastery?
- How will I know I've succeeded?

**Output**: Clear goal statement

**Template**:
```markdown
## Metalearning Map: [Skill]

### WHY: Goal & Motivation

**End Goal**: [Specific, measurable goal]
- Example: "Build 3 full-stack apps using React & Node"
- Not: "Learn web development"

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Criterion 1: [Measurable outcome]
- [ ] Criterion 2: [Measurable outcome]
- [ ] Criterion 3: [Measurable outcome]

**Time Commitment**: [X hours over Y weeks]

**Why This Matters to Me**:
[Intrinsic motivation - why YOU care]

**Deadline**: [If applicable]
```

---

### Hour 3-5: Research "What" to Learn

**Activities**:
1. Find expert curricula (university syllabi, boot camps, books)
2. Interview someone with the skill
3. Identify concepts vs facts vs procedures
4. Map the skill's structure

**Questions**:
- What do experts list as fundamentals?
- What appears in every curriculum?
- What's optional vs essential?
- What's the 20% that gives 80% of value?

**Resources to check**:
- University course syllabi (free online)
- Technical book tables of contents
- Tutorial series outlines
- Job descriptions for the skill
- Reddit threads: "What I wish I knew when learning X"
- YouTube: "X roadmap" videos

**Output**: Concept hierarchy

**Template**:

### Hour 6-8: Design "How" to Learn It

**Activities**:
1. Research how experts learned it
2. Find fastest learners and study their methods
3. Identify proven resources (books, courses, projects)
4. Design practice plan emphasizing directness

**The Directness Principle**: Practice the ACTUAL skill, not proxies.

**Examples**:
- ❌ Want to build apps → Take courses (proxy)
- ✅ Want to build apps → Build apps (direct)
- ❌ Want to speak Spanish → Study grammar (proxy)
- ✅ Want to speak Spanish → Speak with natives (direct)

**Questions**:
- How did fast learners approach this?
- What's the most direct way to practice?
- What's the highest-quality resource?
- What mistakes do beginners make?

**Output**: Learning method and resources

**Template**:
```markdown
### HOW: Learning Method

#### Primary Method: [Direct Practice]
**What**: [The most direct form of practice]
**Why Direct**: [Why this is closer to end goal than alternatives]
**Schedule**: [How often, how long]

Example:
- **What**: Build one full-stack app per week
- **Why Direct**: End goal is building apps, so build apps
- **Schedule**: 10 hours/week for 12 weeks

#### Benchmarking: Fast Learners
**Person 1**: [Who learned this fast] - **Method**: [What they did]
**Person 2**: [Who learned this fast] - **Method**: [What they did]
**Common patterns**: [What successful learners do]

#### Resources (Prioritized)
1. **Primary**: [Best book/course/resource] - [Why best]
2. **Secondary**: [Backup resource] - [Why useful]
3. **Reference**: [Documentation/wiki] - [When to use]

#### Drills & Focused Practice
- Drill 1: [Specific weakness to target] - [How to practice]
- Drill 2: [Specific weakness to target] - [How to practice]

#### Common Beginner Mistakes to Avoid
1. Mistake 1: [What beginners do wrong]
2. Mistake 2: [What beginners do wrong]
3. Mistake 3: [What beginners do wrong]
```

## Advanced Techniques

### The Interview Method
Talk to 3 people who have the skill:
- "How did you learn this?"
- "What do you wish you'd known earlier?"
- "What's overrated vs underrated?"
- "What resources did you use?"

### The Curriculum Analysis
Compare 3-5 expert curricula:
- What topics appear in ALL of them? (Essential)
- What topics appear in NONE of them? (Irrelevant)
- What order do they teach concepts? (Dependency structure)

### The Pareto Principle Applied
Identify highest-leverage components:
- In programming: 20% of syntax = 80% of code
- In language: 1000 words = 80% of conversations
- In math: Core proofs = Understanding for rest

### The Directness Audit
For each learning activity, ask:
> "Does this directly practice my end goal, or is this a proxy?"

Rate each activity on directness scale 1-10.
- 10: Building the actual thing
- 7: Simulated practice
- 5: Exercises similar to goal
- 3: Studying examples
- 1: Reading theory

Prioritize 8+ activities.

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Pitfall 1: Analysis Paralysis
**Problem**: Spending 50% of time researching, never starting
**Solution**: Hard limit 10% of time on metalearning, then START

### ❌ Pitfall 2: Following Expert Curricula Blindly
**Problem**: Experts learned differently than beginners should
**Solution**: Study expert curricula, but adapt for beginner efficiency

### ❌ Pitfall 3: Ignoring Directness
**Problem**: Spending time on proxies instead of actual skill
**Solution**: Constantly ask "Is this directly practicing my goal?"

### ❌ Pitfall 4: No Milestones
**Problem**: Vague "learn X" with no measurable progress
**Solution**: Break into 4-6 concrete milestones with success criteria

---

## Success Criteria

✅ **You've succeeded when:**
- Clear, specific end goal defined
- 20% of content identified (high-leverage)
- Direct practice method designed
- Resources vetted by experts/fast learners
- Timeline with milestones created
- Spent 10% of planned time (not more, not less)
- Ready to start executing with confidence

❌ **You need more metalearning if:**
- Goal is still vague ("learn X")
- Don't know what's essential vs optional
- Relying on proxies instead of direct practice
- No timeline or milestones
- Still researching after 15-20% of time

---

## Integration with Other Skills

**Combine with**:
- `/apply-tracking-discipline` - Track progress against milestones
- `/apply-deliberate-practice` - Design drills for weak areas
- `/apply-encoding-method` - Map concepts from WHAT section

**Workflow**:
```bash
1. /apply-metalearning "Learn system design" (10 hours)
   → Creates metalearning map with direct practice plan

2. /apply-tracking-discipline "Track system design progress" (ongoing)
   → Daily logs against milestones

3. /apply-deliberate-practice "Drill weak areas in system design" (weekly)
   → Focused practice on gaps
```
