# Apply Classification

**Master**: Aristotle
**Core Principle**: "To know is to know by causes. Classification reveals structure."
**Time**: 1-2 hours per domain
**Best For**: Organizing knowledge, building references, systematic understanding, teaching

**Resources**:
- `resources/classification-examples.md` - React hooks, programming languages, detailed examples
- `resources/classification-advanced-techniques.md` - Multiple systems, evolutionary tracking, Venn diagrams
- `resources/classification-templates.md` - Complete templates ready to use

## Aristotle's Method

**Challenge**: Understand all of nature

**Solution**: Systematic classification
- Observe specimens
- Identify common features
- Group by shared characteristics
- Build hierarchical categories
- Define boundaries

**Result**: First comprehensive taxonomies of animals, plants, governments, logic, ethics

**His insight**: "Nature organizes itself. Our job is to reveal that organization."

---

## When to Use This Skill

✅ **Use when:**
- Learning complex domain (many concepts)
- Knowledge feels scattered (need organization)
- Need reference (wiki, documentation)
- Teaching others (classification clarifies)
- Making decisions (compare options systematically)
- Building mental models (structure understanding)

❌ **Don't use when:**
- Domain is simple (< 10 concepts)
- Exploratory phase (too early to categorize)
- Need action, not understanding
- Classification already exists and is good

## The Aristotelian Classification Process

### Step 1: Collect Specimens (30-60 min)

**What**: Gather everything to be classified.

**Aristotle**: Collected animals, plants, rocks
**You**: Collect concepts, tools, patterns, techniques

**Template**:
```markdown
## Classification: [Domain]

### Step 1: Specimens Collected

**All items in domain**:
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
[... continue until complete list]

**Total count**: [N items]

**Collection method**: [How you gathered these]
- Source 1: [Documentation, observation, etc]
- Source 2: [Papers, books, etc]
```

---

### Step 2: Identify Distinguishing Features (20-30 min)

**What**: Find characteristics that differentiate specimens.

**Aristotle's features for animals**:
- Has blood / bloodless
- Lives on land / water / air
- Number of legs
- Gives birth to live young / lays eggs

**Template**:
```markdown
### Step 2: Distinguishing Features

**Feature 1**: [Name]
- Possible values: [A / B / C]
- Examples:
  - Item X has value A
  - Item Y has value B

**Feature 2**: [Name]
- Possible values: [...]
- Examples: [...]

**Key distinguishing features** (most important):
1. Feature A: [Why this matters]
2. Feature B: [Why this differentiates]
```

---

### Step 3: Create Categories (30-45 min)

**What**: Group specimens by shared features. Build hierarchy.

**Template**:
```markdown
### Step 3: Classification Hierarchy

```
Domain
├── Category 1: [Name]
│   ├── Subcategory 1a: [Name]
│   │   ├── Item 1
│   │   └── Item 2
│   └── Subcategory 1b: [Name]
│       ├── Item 3
│       └── Item 4
├── Category 2: [Name]
│   ├── Subcategory 2a: [Name]
│   │   └── Item 5
│   └── Subcategory 2b: [Name]
│       └── Item 6
└── Category 3: [Name]
    └── Item 7
```

**Category definitions**:

**Category 1**: [What makes items belong to this category]
- Defining feature: [Key characteristic]
- Includes: [List items]
- Excludes: [What doesn't belong]
```

**See**: `resources/classification-examples.md` for React hooks, programming languages, and more

---

### Step 4: Define Boundaries (15-20 min)

**What**: Clarify what belongs in each category and what doesn't.

**Why**: Prevents ambiguity, makes classification usable

**Template**:
```markdown
### Step 4: Category Boundaries

#### Category: [Name]

**Includes** (belongs here):
- Item type A: [Why it belongs]
- Item type B: [Why it belongs]

**Excludes** (doesn't belong):
- Item type X: [Why it doesn't belong - goes in Category Y instead]
- Item type Z: [Why it doesn't belong]

**Edge cases**:
- Item W: Could be Category 1 or Category 2. Decision rule: [If X then Category 1, else Category 2]

**Examples**:
- Clear example: [Definitely this category]
- Border example: [Barely this category]
- Non-example: [Definitely NOT this category]
```

---

### Step 5: Create Comparison Table (15-30 min)

**What**: Side-by-side comparison for decision-making.

**Template**:
```markdown
### Step 5: Comparison Table

| Item | Category | Feature 1 | Feature 2 | Feature 3 | Best For | Avoid When |
|------|----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------|------------|
| Item A | Cat 1 | Value | Value | Value | [Use case] | [Anti-pattern] |
| Item B | Cat 1 | Value | Value | Value | [Use case] | [Anti-pattern] |
| Item C | Cat 2 | Value | Value | Value | [Use case] | [Anti-pattern] |

---

## Decision Matrix

**If you need [X]**: Use Item A or Item B
**If you need [Y]**: Use Item C
**If you need [Z]**: None of these, need different approach
```

**See**: `resources/classification-examples.md` for React state hooks comparison table

---

## Common Pitfalls

### ❌ Pitfall 1: Too Many Categories
**Problem**: 20 categories with 1 item each
**Solution**: Aim for 3-7 main categories, subcategories as needed

### ❌ Pitfall 2: Overlapping Categories
**Problem**: Items fit multiple categories, unclear where they belong
**Solution**: Define clear boundaries, or use multiple classification systems

### ❌ Pitfall 3: Classification by Accident
**Problem**: Grouping by superficial similarity (both start with "use")
**Solution**: Classify by essence (what they DO, not what they're CALLED)

### ❌ Pitfall 4: Premature Classification
**Problem**: Classifying before understanding domain
**Solution**: Observe first (Leonardo), then classify (Aristotle)

### ❌ Pitfall 5: Static Classification
**Problem**: Create once, never update as domain evolves
**Solution**: Review and refine classification as you learn more

---

## Success Criteria

✅ **You've succeeded when:**
- Complete taxonomy covers entire domain
- Every item has clear category
- Boundaries are well-defined
- Can use classification to make decisions
- Can teach domain using taxonomy
- Can navigate knowledge quickly (structured reference)
- New items easy to place (taxonomy is stable)

❌ **You need to revise if:**
- Many "miscellaneous" items
- Categories overlap confusingly
- Can't decide where items belong
- Taxonomy doesn't help understanding
- Others can't use your classification

---

## Integration with Other Skills

**Combine with**:
- `/apply-observation-method` - Observe before classifying
- `/apply-pattern-recognition` - Patterns emerge from classification
- `/apply-encoding-method` - Classification is higher-order organization
- `/apply-feynman-technique` - Teach using taxonomy

**Workflow**:
```bash
1. /apply-observation-method "React ecosystem" (30 min)
   → Observe different state management solutions

2. /apply-classification "State management taxonomy"
   → Create: Local (useState) vs Global (Context, Redux) vs Server (React Query)

3. /apply-pattern-recognition "State patterns"
   → Recognize: All follow "read, update" pattern

4. /apply-feynman-technique "Explain state management"
   → Use taxonomy to teach clearly
```

## Quick Reference

**Remember**: "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts." - Aristotle

**Classification reveals the structure. Structure reveals understanding.**
