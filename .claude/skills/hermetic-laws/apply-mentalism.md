## Apply Mentalism - Mental Model Clarification Workflow

### Purpose
Clear the mental fog before building. Align consciousness with intended creation.

### When to Use
- Starting new projects (unclear vision)
- Facing confusion or complexity
- Before major decisions
- When code/architecture feels messy
- Team miscommunication

### The Workflow

**Step 1: Mind Dump**
```
Write down EVERYTHING in your head about this project/problem
- No filtering, no judgment
- Brain dump for 10 minutes
- Get mental noise onto paper
```

**Step 2: Clarify Core Concept**
```
Answer in ONE sentence:
"What is the ESSENCE of what I'm creating?"

Example:
NOT: "A system that handles user data and stuff"
BUT: "A user authentication service using JWT tokens"
```

**Step 3: Draw Mental Model**
```
Sketch the key entities and relationships:
- What are the core concepts? (User, Post, Comment)
- How do they relate? (User creates Posts, Posts have Comments)
- What transforms what? (Login → Auth Token → Access)
```

**Step 4: Validate Coherence**
```
Ask:
- Can I explain this to a 10-year-old?
- Are there contradictions?
- Is this elegantly simple?
- Does this make intuitive sense?

If NO to any → Refine mental model
```

**Step 5: Align Implementation**
```
Now map mental model to reality:
- File structure mirrors concepts
- Function names match mental entities
- Architecture reflects mental model

Mental Model → Implementation (perfect correspondence)
```

### Expected Outcome
- Crystal clear understanding
- Simple, elegant mental model
- Confidence in approach
- Team alignment (if shared)

### Hermetic Truth
"Clear mind → Clear code. Master thought, master creation."
