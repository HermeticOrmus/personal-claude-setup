## Apply Rhythm - Honor Cycles Workflow

### Purpose
Work with natural rhythms. Build sustainable pace. Prevent burnout.

### When to Use
- Feeling burnout approaching
- Unsustainable pace
- Energy crashes
- Poor timing causing failure
- Need better work/life rhythm

### The Workflow

**Step 1: Identify Your Cycles**
Map your natural rhythms:
- Energy peaks (when are you sharpest?)
- Energy valleys (when do you crash?)

Track for 1 week to find patterns.

**Step 2: Align Work to Cycles**
Match task difficulty to energy levels.

**Step 3: Build in Recovery**
For every exertion, plan recovery.
6-day sprint → 1 day rest

**Step 4: Honor the Seasons**
Life has seasons. Don't demand summer all year.

**Step 5: Course Correct Rhythmically**
Check in weekly. Adjust before burnout.

### Hermetic Truth
"Sustainable pace beats heroic bursts. Honor rhythm, honor yourself."
