## Apply Cause-Effect - Trace Causality Workflow

### Purpose
Find root causes. Predict consequences. Make informed decisions.

### When to Use
- Debugging complex problems
- Making important decisions
- Preventing future issues
- Understanding system behavior
- Avoiding unintended consequences

### The Workflow

**Step 1: Effect → Cause (Debug Mode)**
Start with the problem. Ask "Why?" 5 times to find root cause.

**Step 2: Cause → Effect (Prediction Mode)**
Before deciding, trace consequences 5 levels deep.

**Step 3: Map the Causal Chain**
Visualize full chain:
Decision → Immediate → Secondary → Tertiary Effect

**Step 4: Identify Leverage Points**
Where can you intervene most effectively?

**Step 5: Prevent Future Causes**
Build systems that prevent causes from recurring.

### Hermetic Truth
"Nothing happens by chance. Master causality, control outcomes."
