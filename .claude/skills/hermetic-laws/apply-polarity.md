## Apply Polarity - Balance Opposites Workflow

### Purpose
Navigate paradoxes. Balance competing priorities. Find harmony in tension.

### When to Use
- Stuck between two extremes
- "Either/or" thinking
- Competing priorities (speed vs quality)
- Feeling torn between options
- Resolving team disagreements

### The Workflow

**Step 1: Name the Poles**
Identify the two opposing forces:
- Speed ↔ Quality
- Innovation ↔ Stability
- Flexibility ↔ Structure
- Growth ↔ Profitability

Both are valid. Both matter.

**Step 2: Reject False Choice**
It's NOT either/or. It's both/and.

Reframe: "How do we achieve BOTH?"

**Step 3: Find the Balance Point**
Where on the spectrum serves this situation?

The point shifts based on context.

**Step 4: Design for Both**
Create solutions honoring both poles.

**Step 5: Dance Between Poles**
Move fluidly based on needs. Master the dance.

### Hermetic Truth
"Truth lives in balanced tension. Master the poles, not the extremes."
