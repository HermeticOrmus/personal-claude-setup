## Apply Vibration - Momentum Creation Workflow

### Purpose
Break stagnation. Create movement. Ship and iterate.

### When to Use
- Stuck in analysis paralysis
- Perfectionism preventing shipping
- Low energy or motivation
- Project stalled
- Need rapid feedback

### The Workflow

**Step 1: Find Minimum Shippable**
```
What's the SMALLEST thing you can ship today?

NOT: "Complete auth system"
BUT: "Login form that console.logs credentials"

Tiny is fine. Movement matters.
```

**Step 2: Set 2-Hour Timer**
```
Build the minimum shippable in 2 hours
- No perfect
- No polish
- Just WORKING

Done > Perfect
```

**Step 3: Ship It**
```
Deploy/share/publish immediately:
- Push to staging
- Share with one user
- Deploy to production (if safe)

Get it OUT of your head INTO reality
```

**Step 4: Gather Feedback**
```
Real-world data > Assumptions
- How did users react?
- What broke?
- What needs improvement?

Feedback creates clarity
```

**Step 5: Iterate Rapidly**
```
Improve based on feedback
- Fix critical issues
- Enhance based on learning
- Ship again (repeat cycle)

Velocity compounds
```

### Expected Outcome
- Momentum restored
- Feedback loops accelerated
- Clarity through action
- Progress over perfection
- Energy raised

### Hermetic Truth
"Stagnation is death. Movement is life. Ship imperfect and iterate."
