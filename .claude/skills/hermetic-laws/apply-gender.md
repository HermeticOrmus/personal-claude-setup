## Apply Gender - Balance Creative Forces Workflow

### Purpose
Harmonize doing with being. Combine logic with intuition. Create sustainably.

### When to Use
- Burnout from all doing, no being
- Stagnation from all planning, no building
- Need creative breakthrough
- Imbalanced energy

### The Workflow

**Step 1: Assess Current Balance**
Too Masculine (Doing) → Burnout
Too Feminine (Being) → Stagnation

Identify your current imbalance.

**Step 2: Integrate Missing Energy**
If too masculine: Add reflection, rest, intuition
If too feminine: Take action, build, ship

**Step 3: Alternate Phases**
Masculine Phase (Active): Build, execute, ship
Feminine Phase (Receptive): Reflect, integrate, rest

**Step 4: Combine in Decisions**
Logic (Masculine) + Intuition (Feminine) = Wise Choice

**Step 5: Build Rhythmic Practice**
Daily: Morning (masculine) + Evening (feminine)
Weekly: Mon-Fri (work) + Sat-Sun (rest)

### Hermetic Truth
"Generation requires both forces. Balance masculine and feminine for sustainable creation."
