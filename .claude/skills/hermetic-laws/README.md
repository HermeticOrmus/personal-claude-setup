# Hermetic Skills

> Practical workflows applying the 7 Hermetic Laws to real development challenges

## Overview

Hermetic Skills are executable workflows that apply the ancient wisdom of the 7 Hermetic Principles to modern software development, learning, and decision-making challenges.

Each skill combines one or more Hermetic Laws into a practical, step-by-step process you can follow immediately.

## Individual Principle Skills

### `apply-mentalism` - Mental Model Clarity Workflow
**Principle:** Mentalism ("The All is Mind")
**Purpose:** Build crystal-clear mental models before coding

**Use when:**
- Starting new project/feature
- Architecture feels unclear
- Team misaligned on concepts
- Code doesn't match intention

**Workflow:**
1. State the essence in one sentence
2. Identify core concepts (5-7 key entities)
3. Map relationships between concepts
4. Validate coherence (can you explain simply?)
5. Align implementation to mental model

**Expected outcome:** Clear understanding that makes coding obvious

---

### `apply-correspondence` - Pattern Alignment Workflow
**Principle:** Correspondence ("As Above, So Below")
**Purpose:** Ensure patterns align across all system levels

**Use when:**
- Frontend/backend feel disconnected
- API doesn't match domain
- Documentation differs from reality
- System feels inconsistent

**Workflow:**
1. Identify all levels (domain → API → UI → DB)
2. Find pattern at highest level (domain concepts)
3. Verify pattern flows through each level
4. Find misalignments
5. Restore harmony across levels

**Expected outcome:** Consistent patterns from concept to implementation

---

### `apply-vibration` - Momentum Creation Workflow
**Principle:** Vibration ("Nothing rests; everything moves")
**Purpose:** Break through paralysis and create shipping momentum

**Use when:**
- Analysis paralysis
- Overthinking/over-planning
- Fear of starting
- Velocity has stalled

**Workflow:**
1. Define minimum shippable version (MSV)
2. Ship MSV today (not tomorrow)
3. Get real feedback
4. Iterate based on reality (not assumptions)
5. Ship again (maintain vibration)

**Expected outcome:** Movement creates clarity; shipping becomes natural

---

### `apply-polarity` - Balance Opposites Workflow
**Principle:** Polarity ("Everything is Dual")
**Purpose:** Honor both extremes instead of choosing one

**Use when:**
- Facing contradictions
- Either/or decisions
- Trade-off dilemmas
- Team debates stuck

**Workflow:**
1. Name both poles clearly
2. Find truth in each extreme
3. Ask: "How can we honor BOTH?"
4. Design solution that integrates both
5. Move dynamically between poles as needed

**Expected outcome:** "Both/and" solutions instead of "either/or" compromises

---

### `apply-rhythm` - Honor Cycles Workflow
**Principle:** Rhythm ("Everything flows, out and in")
**Purpose:** Create sustainable pace aligned with natural cycles

**Use when:**
- Team burning out
- Unsustainable crunch mode
- Ignoring energy patterns
- Need long-term planning

**Workflow:**
1. Identify natural rhythms (daily, weekly, monthly)
2. Map peak/valley energy times
3. Align deep work to peak times
4. Build rest into valleys
5. Protect the sustainable rhythm

**Expected outcome:** High performance without burnout

---

### `apply-cause-effect` - Trace Causality Workflow
**Principle:** Cause & Effect ("Every Cause has its Effect")
**Purpose:** Understand full consequences before acting

**Use when:**
- Making architectural decisions
- Planning major changes
- Debugging complex issues
- Need to predict outcomes

**Workflow:**
1. State action clearly
2. Trace effects 5 levels deep
3. Validate each causal link
4. Find unintended consequences
5. Decide with full knowledge

**Expected outcome:** Wise decisions based on complete understanding

---

### `apply-gender` - Balance Creative Forces Workflow
**Principle:** Gender ("Gender is in everything")
**Purpose:** Harmonize doing (masculine) with being (feminine)

**Use when:**
- All action, no reflection (burnout)
- All planning, no doing (paralysis)
- Ignoring intuition
- Need creative breakthrough

**Workflow:**
1. Assess: Which force is dominant? (doing vs receiving)
2. Identify what's missing
3. Activate complementary force
4. Let both work together
5. New solutions emerge from balance

**Expected outcome:** Creative synthesis from balanced forces

---

## Combined Principle Skills

### `design-perfect-architecture`
**Principles:** Mentalism + Correspondence + Polarity
**Purpose:** Create elegant, aligned system architecture

**Use when:**
- Designing new system
- Refactoring existing architecture
- System feels messy/inconsistent
- Need to evaluate architecture quality

**Workflow:**
1. **MENTALISM** - Clarify mental model until crystal clear

4. **INTEGRATION** - Synthesize into perfect architecture

**Expected outcome:** Clear + Aligned + Balanced = Perfect architecture

### `ship-sustainably`
**Principles:** Vibration + Rhythm + Gender
**Purpose:** Ship rapidly without burning out

**Use when:**
- Need to ship fast but sustainably
- Balancing speed with team health
- Creating sprint cadence
- Preventing burnout while maintaining velocity

**Workflow:**
1. **VIBRATION** - Create shipping momentum (MVPs fast)
2. **RHYTHM** - Honor sustainable cycles (6-day sprints + rest)
3. **GENDER** - Balance doing with being (work + reflection)
4. **INTEGRATION** - Fast shipping in sustainable cycles

**Expected outcome:** High velocity maintained long-term without burnout

4. **REPRODUCE** - Make bug visible and repeatable
5. **ISOLATE** - Narrow scope through binary search
6. **HYPOTHESIZE** - Form and test predictions
7. **FIX ROOT** - Fix cause (not symptom) + add safeguards
