# Solar System Role Mapping - Celestial Structure with Corporate Clarity
**Date:** November 9, 2025
**Purpose:** Make the Solar System immediately comprehensible through familiar role titles while preserving hermetic structure

---

## 🎯 The Hybrid Approach

**Celestial Name** = Gravitational structure, natural collaboration laws
**Role Title** = Instant comprehension, clear responsibility

**Example:**
- **Neptune** = Hard to grasp immediately
- **Neptune (Backend Architect)** = Instantly clear

Both names together: Structure + Clarity

## 🔄 Orbital Resonance = Team Rituals

**Jupiter ↔ Saturn Resonance (5:2)** = PM ↔ Engineering Manager Check-ins

```
For every 5 features Jupiter proposes:
→ Trigger 2 Saturn capacity reviews

Why: Prevents overcommitment, manages technical debt
Corporate equivalent: Weekly PM/EM sync
```

---

**Venus ↔ Earth Resonance (Direct coupling)** = Designer ↔ Engineer Pairing

```
Venus completes design:
→ Immediately triggers Earth implementation

Why: Tight feedback loop, design consistency
Corporate equivalent: Designer-developer pairing
```

---

**Mars ↔ Sol Resonance (Validation loop)** = QA ↔ Product Review

```
All work returns to Sol through Mars validation:
→ Mars tests → Mars approves → Sol integrates

Why: Quality gate before release
Corporate equivalent: QA sign-off required
```

---

**Neptune ↔ Earth Resonance (API contract)** = Backend ↔ Frontend Contract

```
Neptune changes API:
→ Automatically notifies Earth to update integration

Why: Prevents breaking changes
Corporate equivalent: API versioning, changelog communication
```

## 🎯 How to Use This System

### **For User (You):**

**Traditional approach:**
```
User: "Build auth system"
→ Claude: [tries to do everything]
```

**Solar System with Roles:**
```
User: "Build auth system"
→ Sol (CPO): "I need Design Lead, Backend Architect, Frontend Engineer, QA"
→ Sol delegates to Venus, Neptune, Earth, Mars
→ Each role executes their domain
→ Sol integrates and returns complete system
```

---

### **For Sol (Orchestrator):**

**Role-aware delegation logic:**
```javascript
function solDelegates(request) {
  // Analyze request for roles needed
  const roles = analyzeRoles(request);

  if (roles.includes('backend')) {
    delegate('Neptune', 'Backend Architect');
  }

  if (roles.includes('frontend')) {
    delegate('Earth', 'Frontend Engineer');
  }

  if (roles.includes('design')) {
    delegate('Venus', 'Design Lead');
  }

  if (roles.includes('testing')) {
    delegate('Mars', 'QA Engineer');
  }

  // Coordinate handoffs
  coordinateTeam(roles);
}
```
