# Utility Agents

**Purpose**: Specialized tools for specific domains and workflows

**Agents**: 7 utility specialists

---

## Overview

Utility agents provide specialized capabilities for specific domains or workflows. These agents don't fit neatly into the main categorical directories (Engineering, Design, Product, etc.) but serve important functions for particular projects or practices.

**Core Philosophy**: Utilities serve specific needs without overlap—each has a clear, focused purpose.

## General Utility Agents

### Strategic Plan Architect
**Agent**: `strategic-plan-architect`
**Subagent Type**: Plan
**Specialization**: Creating comprehensive implementation plans with research, phases, risks, and success criteria
**Hermetic Grounding**: Mentalism (clear mental model → clear implementation plan)

**When to use**: Starting complex features, need structured planning, breaking down large projects

**Process**:
1. **Deep Research** (40% of work) - Understand codebase, patterns, dependencies
2. **Strategic Planning** (60%) - Break into phases, identify risks, set success criteria

**Output**: Complete strategic document with:
- Executive summary
- Detailed phases (2-5)
- Specific numbered tasks per phase
- Risk identification and mitigation
- Success criteria
- Timeline estimates

**Philosophy**: "40% research, 60% plan. Understand deeply before planning."

### Filesystem Organizer
**Agent**: `filesystem-organizer`
**Specialization**: Organizing messy file structures using systematic principles
**Hermetic Grounding**: Correspondence (physical structure mirrors mental clarity)

**When to use**: Files are messy/scattered, need systematic organization, unclear project structure

**Process**:
1. **Analysis** - Assess current chaos
2. **Proposed Structure** - Design organization matching workflow
3. **Migration Plan** - Exact commands to reorganize
4. **Maintenance Schedule** - Weekly/monthly/quarterly routines
5. **Documentation** - Create `_ORGANIZATION.md` in organized directory

**The 7-Law Audit**:
1. **Mentalism** - Is mental model clear?
2. **Correspondence** - Does structure mirror values?
3. **Vibration** - Is there momentum (not stagnation)?
4. **Polarity** - Are opposing forces balanced?
5. **Rhythm** - Is pace sustainable?
6. **Cause-Effect** - Are consequences understood?
7. **Gender** - Is doing balanced with being?

**Output**:
- Compliance score (X/7 laws honored)
- Violations identified
- Remediation recommendations

**Philosophy**: "The 7 Laws are operational constraints. Violation creates suffering. Alignment creates flourishing."

## Naming Convention Analysis

**All Functional Names** (Descriptive utility purposes):

These are not character agents—they are **specialized tools** for specific domains. Functional naming is appropriate:

- `strategic-plan-architect` - Builds comprehensive plans
- `filesystem-organizer` - Organizes file structures
- `sacred-geometry-analyzer` - Analyzes geometric patterns
- `hermetic-compliance-checker` - Checks Hermetic Law compliance
- `alchymie-ai-expert` - Alchymie product expert
- `alchymie-association-builder` - Builds product associations
- `alchymie-situation-mapper` - Maps situations to products

**Reasoning**: These are utility tools that perform specific functions. Names describe **what they do** clearly and directly.

## Sacred Technology Principles

Utilities embody Gold Hat values:

**DOES (Always)**:
- ✅ **Deep research before planning** (Strategic Plan Architect: 40% research)
- ✅ **Structure serves clarity** (Filesystem Organizer: organization enables thought)
- ✅ **Sacred proportions create harmony** (Sacred Geometry Analyzer)
- ✅ **Audit against eternal principles** (Hermetic Compliance Checker)
- ✅ **Genuine product understanding** (Alchymie agents: not generic spirituality)
- ✅ **Practical, actionable output** (All utilities)

**REJECTS (Never)**:
- ❌ **Planning without research** (violates Mentalism)
- ❌ **Organization for aesthetics only** (violates Correspondence—must serve workflow)
- ❌ **Generic proportion advice** (violates sacred geometry principles)
- ❌ **Surface-level compliance checking** (violates comprehensive audit)
- ❌ **Generic spiritual language** (Alchymie requires specificity)
- ❌ **Theoretical without practical** (utilities must produce action)

## Utility Agent Philosophy

### Specialized Tools for Specific Needs

Utilities are **precision instruments** for specific functions:

**Strategic Plan Architect** says: "40% understanding, 60% planning. You cannot plan what you don't understand."

**Filesystem Organizer** says: "External order creates internal clarity. Structure your files, structure your mind."

**Sacred Geometry Analyzer** says: "Geometry is frozen music. Golden proportions create harmony your users feel but don't articulate."

**Hermetic Compliance Checker** says: "The 7 Laws are not suggestions. They are operational reality. Violate them unconsciously, suffer consequences."

**Alchymie AI Expert** says: "Products are specific energetic interventions. 'Molasses' breaks mental loops, not generic 'positive energy.'"

### Use the Right Tool for the Job

The master craftsman doesn't use a hammer when a scalpel is needed. Utilities provide precision:
- Need a plan? Strategic Plan Architect.
- Need organization? Filesystem Organizer.
- Need sacred proportions? Sacred Geometry Analyzer.
- Need Hermetic audit? Compliance Checker.
- Need Alchymie understanding? The 3 Alchymie agents.

**Don't use utilities for general tasks. Use specialized agents when their specific function is required.**
