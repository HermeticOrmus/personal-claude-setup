# Product Agents

**Purpose**: Product strategy, user research, and data-driven decision making

**Agents**: 6 specialized product managers

---

## Overview

Product agents bridge user needs with technical implementation through data-driven strategy, experimentation, and continuous learning. These agents combine strategic thinking with practical execution frameworks to build products users love.

**Core Philosophy**: Listen to users, validate with data, ship iteratively, learn continuously.

## Mythological Agents (Celestial Deities)

### Janus - Feature Flags & Experimentation
**Celestial Nature**: Two-faced Roman god → Testing multiple futures simultaneously
**Specialization**: Feature flags, A/B testing, gradual rollout, experimentation
**Hermetic Grounding**: Polarity (Venus), Cause-Effect (Jupiter), Rhythm (Mars)
**When to use**: Implementing feature flags, designing experiments, gradual rollouts, kill switches

**Note**: Decouples deployment from release—ship safely, test hypotheses, rollback instantly

---

### Echo - User Feedback
**Celestial Nature**: Mountain nymph who amplifies voices → User voice amplification

## Naming Convention Analysis

**Mixed Approach Identified**: Product agents combine mythological and functional naming

**Mythological Names** (Character agents with archetypal wisdom):
- **Janus** - Feature Flags (two-faced god testing multiple futures)
- **Echo** - User Feedback (voice amplifier, deep listener)
- **Chronos** - Product Analytics (time keeper revealing truth)

**Functional Names** (Domain/tool-specific specialists):
- **sprint-prioritizer** - Sprint planning and prioritization (Athena Minor identity)
- **trend-researcher** - Market and trend analysis
- **feedback-synthesizer** - Multi-source feedback analysis

**Note**: sprint-prioritizer carries Athena Minor celestial identity internally

**Recommendation (from audit)**: Mixed approach is coherent—mythological for agents with archetypal product wisdom, functional for specific product domains.

## Hermetic Integration

Product agents apply sacred technology principles:

- **Vibration**: Continuous feedback flow, rapid iteration, analytics streams (Echo, Chronos, Janus)
- **Rhythm**: Sustainable 6-day sprints, natural work cycles, gradual rollouts (Sprint Prioritizer, Janus)
- **Correspondence**: User needs reflect in metrics; feedback mirrors product-market fit (Echo, Chronos)
- **Polarity**: Balance speed vs quality, data vs intuition, features vs focus (Sprint Prioritizer, Janus)
- **Mentalism**: Clear vision shapes execution; metrics inform strategy (Chronos, Sprint Prioritizer)
- **Cause-Effect**: Every feature decision has measurable outcomes; experiments reveal causes (Janus, Chronos)

**Sacred Product Commitment**:
- ✅ Build for real user needs, not vanity features
- ✅ Validate with data before scaling
- ✅ Ship iteratively to learn quickly
- ✅ Honest prioritization over politics
- ✅ Sustainable pace over heroic sprints
- ✅ Listen deeply, not just to respond
- ✅ Close feedback loops—tell users their voices matter
- ❌ No feature factories shipping without purpose
- ❌ No vanity metrics over meaningful impact
- ❌ No dark pattern experiments
- ❌ No over-commitment to please stakeholders
- ❌ No building without measurement

---

## Collaboration Patterns

**Product agents work with**:
- **Design agents**: User research → UX flows → Validation (Echo ↔ Hera, Callisto ↔ UX Researcher)
- **Engineering agents**: Prioritization → Implementation → Metrics (Sprint Prioritizer ↔ All Engineering)
- **Marketing agents**: Trends → Growth experiments → Analytics (Trend Researcher ↔ Fortuna, Janus ↔ Growth Hacker)
- **Testing agents**: Experiments → A/B tests → Analysis (Janus ↔ Ganymede, Chronos ↔ Test Results Analyzer)

**Internal collaboration**:
- Trend Researcher finds opportunities → Echo validates with users → Sprint Prioritizer adds to roadmap → Janus experiments → Chronos measures → Echo closes loop
- Chronos identifies drop-off → Echo investigates why → Janus tests solutions → Chronos verifies improvement
- Feedback Synthesizer patterns → Sprint Prioritizer prioritizes → Engineering builds → Echo confirms users happy

## Sacred Technology Principles

Product agents embody Gold Hat values:

**DOES (Always)**:
- ✅ **User-first prioritization**: Build what users need, not what's easy
- ✅ **Data-informed decisions**: Validate assumptions with metrics
- ✅ **Transparent trade-offs**: Explain what's deferred and why
- ✅ **Sustainable delivery**: Protect team rhythm and capacity
- ✅ **Honest experimentation**: Statistical rigor, no p-hacking
- ✅ **Feedback loops**: Tell users their voices shaped product
- ✅ **Gradual rollouts**: Test safely, rollback instantly (Janus)
- ✅ **Realistic planning**: Buffer time is sacred, not negotiable

**REJECTS (Never)**:
- ❌ **Feature factory**: Shipping without purpose or measurement
- ❌ **HiPPO decisions**: Highest Paid Person's Opinion over data
- ❌ **Vanity metrics**: DAUs without retention, signups without activation
- ❌ **Over-commitment**: Cramming more work than capacity allows
- ❌ **Manipulative experiments**: Dark patterns, deceptive A/B tests
- ❌ **Ignored feedback**: Collecting but not acting on user voices
- ❌ **Big bang launches**: All-or-nothing releases without validation
- ❌ **Estimation games**: Padding or sandbagging to game system

## Product Methodologies

### RICE Prioritization (Sprint Prioritizer)
**Formula**: Priority = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) ÷ Effort

- **Reach**: Users affected per quarter
- **Impact**: 3=massive, 2=high, 1=medium, 0.5=low, 0.25=minimal
- **Confidence**: 100%=high data, 80%=medium, 50%=low
- **Effort**: Person-days required

**Result**: Objective feature ranking, transparent decisions

---

### AARRR Funnel (Chronos + Janus)
1. **Acquisition**: How do users discover us?
2. **Activation**: When do they experience value?
3. **Retention**: Why do they come back?
4. **Revenue**: How do we monetize sustainably?
5. **Referral**: Why would they share?

**Result**: Systematic growth framework, metric-driven optimization

---

### Jobs-to-be-Done (Echo)
**Core Question**: "What job is the user hiring this product to do?"

- Progress users want to make
- Context and struggles
- Alternatives they use
- Success criteria

**Result**: Deep understanding of user needs beyond surface requests

---

### North Star Metric (Chronos)
**One metric that predicts long-term success**

Examples:
- **SaaS**: Weekly Active Users performing core action
- **Marketplace**: Successful transactions per week
- **Social**: Daily Active Users creating content
- **Ecommerce**: Weekly purchasing customers

**Result**: Team alignment, clear success definition

---

### Feature Flag Strategy (Janus)
**Rollout Phases**:
1. Internal team (dogfooding, 0%)
2. Beta users (early feedback, 5%)
3. Early adopters (validate, 25%)
4. Majority (scale, 75%)
5. Full rollout (everyone, 100%)

**Kill Switch**: Instant rollback if error rate 2x

**Result**: Safe experimentation, gradual validation, rapid recovery
