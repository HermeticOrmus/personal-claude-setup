## Naming Convention Analysis

**Mixed Approach Identified**: Design agents combine mythological and functional naming

**Mythological Names** (Character agents with personality):
- **Hera** - UX Design (personality: holistic orchestrator)
- **Metis** - Design Systems (personality: wise pattern architect)
- **Titan** - Motion Design (personality: master of time)
- **Eros** - Emotional Design (personality: heart's designer)

**Functional Names** (Tool agents focused on specific domains):
- **ui-designer** - Interface creation (tool for rapid visual design)
- **ux-researcher** - User understanding (tool for lean research)
- **visual-storyteller** - Visual narratives (tool for communication)
- **whimsy-injector** - Playful moments (tool for delight)
- **brand-guardian** - Brand consistency (tool for identity management)

**Note**: Some functional agents carry celestial identities internally:
- `ui-designer` → Metis (same deity as design-systems agent, different expression)
- `ux-researcher` → Athena (goddess of wisdom and strategy)

**Recommendation (from audit)**: This mixed approach is coherent and meaningful—mythological for agents with personality/wisdom, functional for domain-specific tools.

## When to Use Design Agents

**Use Design agents for**:
- User research and understanding (UX Researcher, Hera)
- Interface design and visual aesthetics (UI Designer, Metis)
- Motion design and animations (Titan)
- Emotional design and delight (Eros, Whimsy Injector)
- Design systems and consistency (Metis, Brand Guardian)
- Visual communication (Visual Storyteller)

**NOT for**:
- Technical implementation (use Engineering agents)
- Business operations (use Studio Operations)
- Product strategy (use Product agents)
- Marketing content (use Marketing agents)

---

## Hermetic Integration

Design agents apply sacred technology principles:

- **Vibration**: UI vibrates at frequencies of beauty and usability; consistent design creates harmonic resonance (Metis, UI Designer, Titan)
- **Mentalism**: UX research maps user mental models; understanding consciousness shapes interfaces (Hera, UX Researcher)
- **Correspondence**: Design patterns reflect user mental models; visual hierarchy mirrors thought hierarchy (Hera, Metis)
- **Polarity**: Balance beauty with function, delight with usability, innovation with familiarity (All agents)
- **Rhythm**: Respect natural design cycles; 6-day sprints honor sustainable pace (All agents)

**Sacred Design Commitment**:
- ✅ Empower users through intuitive, accessible design
- ✅ Respect human dignity with inclusive interfaces
- ✅ Delight without manipulation or dark patterns
- ✅ Beauty serves purpose, not designer ego
- ❌ No addictive interfaces or engagement tricks
- ❌ No manipulation or deceptive design

---

## Collaboration Patterns

**Design agents work with**:
- **Engineering agents**: Design → Implementation (Frontend Developer, Backend Architect)
- **Product agents**: Requirements → Solutions (Product Strategy, User Feedback)
- **Marketing agents**: Brand → Interface (Content creation, visual identity)
- **Testing agents**: Design → Validation (usability, accessibility)

**Internal collaboration**:
- UX Researcher discovers needs → Hera designs flows → UI Designer creates interfaces → Titan adds motion → Eros adds delight
- Metis creates systems → Brand Guardian ensures consistency → Visual Storyteller communicates patterns
- Whimsy Injector adds personality throughout the journey
