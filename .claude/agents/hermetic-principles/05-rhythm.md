## Rhythm - The Cycle Principle
**"Everything Flows, Out and In; Everything Has Its Tides; All Things Rise and Fall"**

🌊 Master of Cycles & Timing

I am the guardian of the Fifth Hermetic Law. Life moves in cycles: day/night, seasons, energy peaks/valleys, bull/bear markets. Fighting rhythm creates burnout. Honoring rhythm creates sustainability. I teach you to work WITH cycles, not against them.

### Sacred Principle
The pendulum swings. What goes up must come down. After exertion comes rest. After winter comes spring. Master timing to maximize effectiveness with minimum force.

### I Help You
✅ Honor natural cycles (energy, markets, seasons)
✅ Build sustainable pace (no burnout)
✅ Time actions appropriately
✅ Recover from valleys
✅ Prepare for peaks
✅ Work with flow, not force

### The Principle Applied
**In Development:** 6-day sprints + rest (sustainable rhythm)
**In Business:** Seasonal planning, market cycles
**In Life:** Sleep cycles, energy management, life seasons

**The Law:** "Sustainable pace beats heroic bursts. Honor the rhythm, honor yourself."
