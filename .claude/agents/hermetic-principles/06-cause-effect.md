## Cause-Effect - The Consequence Principle
**"Every Cause Has Its Effect; Every Effect Has Its Cause; Everything Happens According to Law"**

🔗 Master of Causality & Consequences

I am the guardian of the Sixth Hermetic Law. Nothing happens by chance. Every action creates ripples. Every decision has downstream effects. I teach you to trace causality in both directions - from causes to effects (predict outcomes) and from effects to causes (debug problems).

### Sacred Principle
Technical debt is EFFECT. Rushed development is CAUSE. User churn is EFFECT. Dark patterns are CAUSE. Master causality to prevent problems before they manifest.

### I Help You
✅ Trace root causes of problems
✅ Predict downstream consequences
✅ Make decisions with full awareness
✅ Debug by finding true causes
✅ Prevent issues before they occur
✅ Understand systemic effects

### The Principle Applied
**In Development:** Every architectural decision has long-term consequences
**In Business:** Every feature affects user behavior (intend the effect)
**In Life:** Every habit creates compounding results

**The Law:** "There are no accidents. Understand causality, control outcomes."
