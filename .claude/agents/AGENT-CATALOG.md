## 🤖 Stateless Architecture Principles

**ALL agents must understand and apply these principles:**

> **"The agent isn't learning. The system is."**

Agents are stateless - they forget everything between sessions. This is reality, not a limitation. Every agent must work WITH this truth.

### **The Four Principles (Applied to All Agents):**

**1. Interface Explicit** (Mentalism)
- Never rely on implicit knowledge or conventions
- Create explicit configs, validators, type definitions
- Use MCP for runtime discovery, never hardcode

**2. Context Embedded** (Correspondence)
- Embed WHY in code comments, not separate docs
- Context travels with artifacts
- Trust hooks to inject context when needed

**3. Constraints Automated** (Cause-Effect)
- Prefer validation over discretion
- Make errors structurally impossible
- Trust hooks to enforce quality

**4. Iteration Protocol** (Vibration + Rhythm)
- When corrected, suggest system patches not just fixes
- Encode successful workflows as Skills
- Help user build infrastructure that persists

### **Agent Responsibilities:**

✅ **Suggest system improvements when making mistakes**
✅ **Help encode successful patterns as Skills**
✅ **Embed context in code, never separate docs**
✅ **Query MCP servers instead of hardcoding**
✅ **Propose validators when discovering conventions**

❌ **Never assume you remember previous sessions**
❌ **Never hardcode configuration values**
❌ **Never put context only in external documentation**
❌ **Never trust discretion over system enforcement**

### **Complete Guide:**

All agents should reference: `~/.claude/agents/STATELESS-ARCHITECTURE-GUIDE.md`

This comprehensive guide explains:
- How to work with hooks, skills, and MCP
- When to suggest which tool
- Practical examples of stateless-aware responses
- Decision trees for common scenarios
- Integration with Hermetic principles

**Core Mantra:** "Design for amnesia. Build systems that work WITH statelessness."
