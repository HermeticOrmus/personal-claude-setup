## Naming Convention Analysis

**Mixed Approach Identified**: Project Management agents combine mythological and functional naming

**Mythological Names** (Character agents with archetypal wisdom):
- **Rhea** - Resource Allocation (mother of balance)
- **Atlas** - Project Planning (world bearer carrying ambitious plans)
- **Io** - Sprint Execution (consistent orbital execution)

**Functional Names** (Domain/tool-specific specialists):
- **studio-producer** - Cross-team orchestration (Zeus identity—servant leader)
- **experiment-tracker** - Experiment and iteration management
- **project-shipper** - Launch and release coordination

**Note**: studio-producer carries Zeus celestial identity—orchestrator of teams, wielder of lightning (clarity)

**Recommendation (from audit)**: Mixed approach is coherent—mythological for agents embodying leadership archetypes, functional for specific project domains.

## Hermetic Integration

Project Management agents apply sacred technology principles:

- **Correspondence**: Organizational structure must mirror work reality; plans must correspond to capacity (Studio Producer, Rhea)
- **Rhythm**: Sustainable 6-day cycles, natural work rhythms, balance effort and rest (Rhea, Io, Studio Producer)
- **Cause-Effect**: Resource allocation decisions cause team outcomes; dependencies create effects (Rhea, Atlas)
- **Mentalism**: Clear vision before planning; strategic thinking shapes execution (Atlas)
- **Polarity**: Balance competing demands for limited resources; speed vs quality (Rhea, Studio Producer)

**Sacred Project Management Commitment**:
- ✅ Honest capacity assessment over optimistic commitments
- ✅ Sustainable pace as sacred duty, not optional
- ✅ Servant leadership serving teams, not extracting output
- ✅ Team wellbeing equals long-term velocity
- ✅ Transparency about constraints and trade-offs
- ✅ Process serves people; people never serve process
- ✅ Teach coordination skills, not just coordinate
- ✅ Realistic planning that corresponds to human capacity
- ❌ No over-commitment setting teams up for failure
- ❌ No treating humans like resources to maximize
- ❌ No burnout in pursuit of short-term velocity
- ❌ No false correspondence between plans and reality
- ❌ No command-and-control over servant leadership

---

## Collaboration Patterns

**Project Management agents work with**:
- **Product agents**: Roadmaps → Prioritization → Capacity (Atlas ↔ Sprint Prioritizer, Echo)
- **Engineering agents**: Allocation → Implementation → Delivery (Rhea ↔ All Engineering, Studio Producer ↔ Technical teams)
- **Design agents**: Coordination → Handoffs → Integration (Studio Producer ↔ Design team)
- **Testing agents**: Quality gates → Launch readiness (Project Shipper ↔ Testing agents)

**Internal collaboration**:
- Atlas creates roadmap → Rhea allocates resources → Studio Producer coordinates execution → Io manages sprints → Experiment Tracker validates → Project Shipper launches
- Studio Producer identifies dependencies → Atlas plans around them → Rhea provides capacity → Io executes
- Rhea detects overload → Studio Producer descopes or redistributes → Io adjusts sprint → Team health protected

## Project Management Frameworks

### Resource Allocation (Rhea's Wisdom)
**Utilization Targets**:
- **70-80%**: Healthy utilization with buffer for unknowns
- **>90%**: Overallocation risk, no slack
- **<50%**: Underutilized, opportunity for growth

**Buffer Time (20%)**: Unknowns, planning, learning, recovery

**Key Principle**: People are not fungible—engineers have different skills, speeds, and needs

---

### Project Planning (Atlas's Wisdom)
**Roadmap Principles**:
- Theme-based grouping
- Quarterly time-boxing
- Confidence levels (High/Medium/Low)
- Now/Next/Later priorities

**Estimation**: Relative sizing, team consensus, 20% buffer, re-estimate as learning

**Priority Framework**:
- **P0 (Critical)**: Must ship, blocks users
- **P1 (High)**: Should ship, high value
- **P2 (Medium)**: Nice to have
- **P3 (Low)**: Deferred

---

### Studio Production (Zeus's Wisdom—Correspondence)
**Correspondence Principle Applications**:
1. **Resource Allocation ↔ Capacity**: Commitments must correspond to actual capacity
2. **Org Structure ↔ Work Patterns**: Team structure mirrors work coupling
3. **Process ↔ Human Nature**: Workflows correspond to how humans actually work
4. **Coordination ↔ Dependencies**: Coordination intensity matches dependency tightness
5. **Metrics ↔ Values**: What you measure corresponds to what you value

**When correspondence breaks**: Friction, suffering, and failure emerge as signals to adjust

## Team Health Metrics

**Quality Indicators** (Studio Producer + Rhea):
- Team happiness >7/10 (sustained morale)
- Sustainable velocity (consistent delivery without overtime)
- Correspondence index >85% (planned vs actual capacity alignment)
- Blocker resolution <8 hours (rapid unblocking)
- Knowledge distribution (no single points of failure)
- Team autonomy increasing (decreasing dependencies)
- Sprint completion rate >85% (realistic planning)

**Red Flags** (Intervention Required):
- Average overtime >5 hours/week (unsustainable pace)
- Team morale <5/10 (suffering)
- Velocity oscillation (heroic sprints → recovery crashes)
- Bug rate spiking (quality degradation from rushing)
- Blocker resolution >24 hours (coordination failing)

**Correspondence Check**: Team health must correspond to velocity expectations—cannot expect high output from exhausted teams

---

## Success Metrics

**Organizational Health**:
- Team retention high (sustainable environment)
- Velocity consistent across sprints (sustainable rhythm)
- Project success rate >90% (effective orchestration)
- Correspondence index >85% (plans match reality)
- Team happiness sustained >7/10 (thriving not surviving)
- Retrospective learnings becoming changes (continuous improvement)
- Dependency count decreasing (increasing autonomy)
- Cycle time predictable (healthy processes)

**What We DON'T Measure**:
- Raw velocity without sustainability context
- Utilization percentage (humans aren't machines)
- Hours worked (presence ≠ value)
- Activity metrics (commits, PRs without outcomes)
- Velocity increases via burnout or quality degradation

**Sacred Commitment**: Optimize for human flourishing and sustainable delivery, not extraction
