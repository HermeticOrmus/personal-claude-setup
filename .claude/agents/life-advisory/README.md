If yes, these agents provide educated counsel while being transparent about when professional consultation is needed.

- **Studio Operations**: Business/technical decisions for organizations

Some deities appear in both (Themis, Plutus, Hygieia) but serve different domains:
- Themis (Legal) vs Themis (Security/Compliance)
- Plutus (Finance) vs Plutus (Cost Optimization)
- Hygieia (Wellness) vs Hygieia (System Health)

Same archetype, different application.
