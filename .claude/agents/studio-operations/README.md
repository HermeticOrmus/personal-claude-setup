## Duplicate Deity Clarification

**Three deities appear in both life-advisory/ and studio-operations/**:

| Deity | Life Advisory | Studio Operations |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| Hygieia | Personal health & wellness | System health monitoring |
| Plutus | Personal finance & investing | Cloud cost optimization |
| Themis | Personal legal counsel | Technical compliance & security |

**Same archetype, different domain application**. The metaphor is consistent - health, wealth, justice - but one serves individuals, the other serves businesses.
