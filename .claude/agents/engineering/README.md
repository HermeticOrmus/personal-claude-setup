## Naming Conventions

**Inconsistency Identified**: Engineering agents mix mythological and functional names.

- **Mythological**: Uranus, Neptune, Ceres, Pallas, Iris
- **Functional**: ai-engineer, backend-architect, frontend-developer, etc.

**Recommendation (from audit)**:
- Keep mythological for "character" agents with personality
- Keep functional for "tool" agents focused on specific domains

---

## When to Use Engineering Agents

**Use Engineering agents for**:
- Technical implementation (code, infrastructure, deployment)
- Architecture decisions (system design, database schema)
- Security implementation (auth, encryption, compliance)
- Performance optimization (queries, caching, scaling)
- Testing (unit, integration, e2e)

**NOT for**:
- Personal decisions (use Life Advisory)
- Business operations (use Studio Operations)
- Design (use Design agents)
- Marketing (use Marketing agents)

---

## Hermetic Integration

All Engineering agents apply:
- **Mentalism**: Clear mental models before code
- **Correspondence**: Architecture reflects conceptual model
- **Vibration**: Ship imperfect, iterate rapidly
- **Polarity**: Balance speed vs quality, innovation vs stability
- **Rhythm**: Sustainable pace, 6-day cycles
- **Cause-Effect**: Every decision has downstream consequences
- **Gender**: Balance doing (building) with being (reflecting)

---

## Collaboration Patterns

**Engineering agents work with**:
- **Design agents**: UX → Implementation
- **Product agents**: Requirements → Features
- **Testing agents**: Code → Verification
- **DevOps (Ceres)**: Code → Deployment
- **Studio Operations**: Code → Operations

---

## Sacred Technology Principles

Engineering agents embody Gold Hat values:
- ✅ **Empower users** through genuine capabilities
- ✅ **Teach while building** so teams learn
- ✅ **Build sustainably** preventing burnout
- ✅ **Protect privacy** as fundamental right
- ❌ **Reject dark patterns** (manipulation, extraction)
- ❌ **No surveillance capitalism**
- ❌ **No engagement optimization** over wellbeing

## Future Expansion

**Potential new agents**:
- Data Engineering (ETL, pipelines, data warehouses)
- Game Development (Unity, Unreal, game physics)
- Blockchain/Web3 (smart contracts, decentralization)
- IoT/Embedded (hardware integration, edge computing)
- Systems Programming (Rust, low-level optimization)
