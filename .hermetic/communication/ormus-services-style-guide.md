## Core Identity: Ormus

**Full Identity**: Diego Gabriel Bodart Miro → **Ormus the Messenger of The Fire of The Heart**

**Professional Brand**: **Ormus** (for all client-facing communication)

**What Ormus Represents:**
- Hermetic technology practitioner
- Sacred technology advocate (Gold Hat philosophy)
- Transformation through conscious code
- Human empowerment over extraction

**Not:**
- Corporate vendor
- Generic developer
- Disconnected technician

---

## Client Communication Philosophy

**Core Principle**: *Clients deserve clarity, warmth, and respect—not corporate performance.*

### What Makes Ormus Different:

**Traditional Developer Communication:**
- Generic updates without context
- Technical jargon that excludes
- Over-promising, under-explaining
- Transactional coldness OR fake friendliness

**Ormus Communication:**
- Clear updates with context (what changed, why it matters)
- Technical enough to trust, accessible enough to understand
- Realistic commitments with transparency
- Genuine warmth without performance

---

## Message Structure for Clients

### **Standard Client Update Template**

```
[Greeting]

[Project Name] [Status/Milestone]

[URL or Access Info]

*What's New:*
• [Specific feature/update they requested]
• [Specific feature/update they requested]
• [Technical infrastructure note - brief]

[Optional: What This Means For Them]

[Next steps or call to action]

— Ormus
```

### **Example (FloreSer):**

```
Hi Cynthia! 🌸

FloreSer is live: https://website-zeta-murex-70.vercel.app

*What's New:*
• Updated copy throughout the site
• Community Garden is fully functional with mAIa integration
• The Hive section is live with practitioner content features
• All pollinator archetypes active (Bee, Hummingbird, Butterfly, Beetle)

The platform is now on professional infrastructure (Vercel + Neon PostgreSQL) - independent, secure, and scalable.

Take a look around and let me know what you think!

— Ormus
```

---

## Tone Calibration by Relationship Stage

### **New Client (First 1-3 Interactions)**

**Tone**: Professional, clear, establishing trust

**Pattern:**
1. Clear introduction
2. Specific deliverable or update
3. What they need to know/do
4. Professional close

**Example:**
```
Hi [Name],

Ormus here with your [project] update.

[Specific update with context]

[What they should know or do next]

Let me know if you have questions.

— Ormus
```

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Over-familiarity
- ❌ Assuming they understand technical context
- ❌ Leaving them guessing on next steps

---

### **Established Client (Ongoing Relationship)**

**Tone**: Warm professional, more conversational

**Pattern:**
1. Warm greeting (first name + relevant emoji IF it fits the brand)
2. Direct update
3. Specific changes they requested highlighted
4. Next steps or invitation to respond
5. Sign off: "— Ormus"

**Example (FloreSer - Established):**
```
Hi Cynthia! 🌸

FloreSer update: [milestone/feature]

*What's New:*
• [Their requested features first]
• [Technical/infrastructure updates]

[Brief context on why this matters]

[Invitation to engage]

— Ormus
```

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Becoming too casual (maintain professionalism)
- ❌ Assuming they remember all technical details
- ❌ Generic "hope you're well" filler

---

### **VIP/High-Stakes Client**

**Tone**: Complete, proactive, anticipating needs

**Pattern:**
1. Direct subject/status line
2. Comprehensive update with sections
3. Proactive addressing of potential questions
4. Clear timeline and next actions
5. What you need from them (if anything)
6. Professional close

**Template:**
```
[Name],

🔱 [PROJECT] - [STATUS] Update

**Current Status:**
[One-line summary]

**What's Complete:**
✅ [Item]
✅ [Item]

**What's Live:**
• [Feature with context]
• [Feature with context]

**Technical Infrastructure:**
[Brief explanation of what this means for stability/scale/security]

**Next:**
[Timeline with specific dates]

**Need from You:**
[Specific decision/input, or "Nothing - just keeping you updated"]

— Ormus
```

---

## Language Selection for Clients

### **Default: Match Their Language**
- Client initiates in Spanish → Respond in Spanish
- Client initiates in English → Respond in English
- Exception: Technical documentation always available in both

### **Code-Switching for Bilingual Clients**
- Natural technical terms in English within Spanish OK
- Example: "El deployment está complete" (common in tech Spanish)
- Never force it - match their natural pattern

### **Sign-Off Consistency**
- Always: "— Ormus" (regardless of language)
- Never: "Saludos," "Best regards," "Sincerely," etc.
- Exception: Formal proposals/contracts can use traditional closings

---

## Emoji Philosophy for Client Communication

### **When to Use Emoji:**

**Brand-Aligned Emoji (Minimal, Functional):**
- 🌸 = FloreSer brand (wellness, growth)
- 🔱 = Hermetic brand (sacred technology)
- ✅ = Completion status
- 🚀 = Launch/deployment
- ⚠️ = Important notice

**When:**
- In greeting IF it aligns with client's brand (🌸 for FloreSer)
- Status indicators in structured updates
- Section headers in technical updates

**Never:**
- ❌ Generic friendliness emoji (😊 🙏 ✨)
- ❌ Multiple emoji in one message
- ❌ Emoji as punctuation
- ❌ Emoji in formal proposals/contracts

**Test**: "Does this emoji represent something functional or brand-specific?"
- Yes → Keep it
- No → Remove it

---

## Problem Communication

### **Reporting Issues/Delays to Clients**

**Pattern:**
1. State the fact (no burying the lead)
2. Why it happened (brief, no excuses)
3. What you've done about it
4. New timeline/solution
5. What they need to know/do

**Template:**
```
[Name],

⚠️ **[Project] Update: [Issue/Delay]**

**Situation:**
[Clear statement of what's happening]

**Reason:**
[Brief, honest explanation - no corporate speak]

**Already Handled:**
[What you've done to fix/prevent]

**New Timeline:**
[Specific dates/milestones]

**Impact:**
[What this means for them - budget/features/launch]

**Need from You:**
[Specific decision, or "Nothing - just keeping you updated"]

— Ormus
```

**Principles:**
- Lead with the fact
- Own it without over-apologizing
- Show what you've done (not just what went wrong)
- Give them control (decisions they need to make)

**Avoid:**
- ❌ "Unfortunately..." (weak)
- ❌ "We regret to inform..." (corporate)
- ❌ Passive voice
- ❌ Vague timelines
- ❌ Hiding impact

---

## Feature Request Responses

### **Client Asks for New Feature**

**Pattern:**
1. Acknowledge request
2. Clarify understanding (if needed)
3. Feasibility assessment
4. Timeline or alternative
5. Next step

**Template (Feasible):**
```
Great idea.

[Restate their request to confirm understanding]

I can add this in [timeframe].

[Brief note on technical approach or trade-offs]

Want to prioritize this over [other pending item]?

— Ormus
```

**Template (Not Feasible):**
```
I hear you on wanting [feature].

[Explain why it's not feasible - technical or scope]

Alternative: [Suggest similar solution that IS feasible]

Would that work for your use case?

— Ormus
```

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Immediate "yes" without thinking
- ❌ Immediate "no" without alternatives
- ❌ Technical jargon that excludes
- ❌ Making them feel bad for asking

---

## Scope Creep Management

### **Client Adds "One More Thing"**

**When It's Minor:**
```
Sure, I can add that.

[Brief timeline]

— Ormus
```

**When It Changes Scope:**
```
That's a bigger shift than it sounds.

[Explain why - time/complexity/dependencies]

Options:
1. Add it now: [timeline + cost impact]
2. Add it after launch: [Phase 2 approach]
3. Adjust scope: [Trade-off - remove X to add Y]

Which makes most sense for your launch?

— Ormus
```

**Principles:**
- Say "yes" when you can
- Say "it's complex" when you can't
- Always offer options
- Frame in terms of their goals (not your effort)

---

## Milestone Communication

### **Major Milestone/Launch**

**Pattern:**
1. Clear announcement
2. What's live/accessible
3. What this means for them
4. What's next (if anything)
5. Invitation to explore

**Template:**
```
[Name]! 🚀

[Project] is live: [URL]

**What's Ready:**
✅ [Feature]
✅ [Feature]
✅ [Feature]

[Brief context on what this means - users can do X, platform can handle Y]

[Next steps or invitation]

— Ormus
```

**Tone:** Celebratory but grounded. You built something real, not saving the world.

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Over-the-top celebration
- ❌ Taking credit excessively
- ❌ Making it about the tech instead of their vision

---

## Response Time Expectations

### **By Client Type:**

**Established Clients:**
- Same-day for questions
- Immediate for critical issues
- Weekly updates on ongoing projects (unless milestone-based)

**New Clients:**
- Within 4 hours during work hours
- Within 24 hours on weekends
- Set expectations upfront if you batch responses

**VIP/High-Stakes:**
- Within 1 hour during work hours
- Same day on weekends
- Proactive updates (don't wait to be asked)

### **Setting Boundaries:**

**Upfront Communication:**
```
I check messages twice daily (10am/4pm Panama time).

For urgent issues: Call me at [number].

Weekly updates: Every Friday by 5pm.
```

**Don't apologize for:**
- Having boundaries
- Not responding instantly
- Working sustainable hours

**Do communicate:**
- Your response rhythm
- How to reach you for emergencies
- When they can expect updates

---

## Client Onboarding Message

### **First Message to New Client**

**Template:**
```
[Name],

Ormus here - I'll be building [project] with you.

**What to Expect:**

*Communication:*
I'll send updates [frequency] via WhatsApp. For urgent needs, call me at [number].

*Process:*
[Brief overview of how you work - sprints/milestones/etc.]

*First Step:*
[What you need from them to start]

Questions before we begin?

— Ormus
```

**Tone:** Professional, clear, establishing trust

**Purpose:** Set expectations, reduce anxiety, show you're organized

---

## Examples: Before & After

### **Example 1: Feature Update**

**Before (Generic):**
> "Hi! Just wanted to let you know that I finished implementing the features we discussed. Everything is working now. Let me know if you want to test it!"

**After (Ormus Style):**
> "Cynthia,
>
> Community Garden is live with the updates you requested:
> • Content moderation workflow
> • Category filtering
> • mAIa integration
>
> https://floreser.life/garden
>
> Ready for your first test - let me know what you think!
>
> — Ormus"

**Why Better:** Specific features, URL provided, clear call to action, professional sign-off.

---

### **Example 2: Delay Notice**

**Before (Apologetic):**
> "I'm so sorry but there's been a delay with the project. We ran into some unexpected technical issues and it's taking longer than expected. I feel terrible about this!"

**After (Ormus Style):**
> "David,
>
> ⚠️ **Timeline Update: 3-Day Delay**
>
> **New Delivery:** Friday Nov 15 (was Tuesday Nov 12)
>
> **Reason:** Third-party API rate limits during testing
>
> **Fixed:** Implemented caching layer to prevent future blocks
>
> **Impact:** No change to features or budget
>
> Let me know if Friday works or if we need to adjust.
>
> — Ormus"

**Why Better:** Leads with fact, explains briefly, shows solution, gives control.

---

### **Example 3: Scope Clarification**

**Before (Vague):**
> "That's going to be a lot of work. Can we talk about it?"

**After (Ormus Style):**
> "That's a bigger change than it sounds.
>
> Adding real-time chat means:
> • WebSocket infrastructure (2 days)
> • Message encryption (1 day)
> • New database tables (1 day)
> • Testing across devices (2 days)
>
> Options:
> 1. Add it now: +6 days, +$X
> 2. Launch without, add in Phase 2
> 3. Use third-party chat widget (1 day, monthly cost)
>
> Which fits your timeline?
>
> — Ormus"

**Why Better:** Breaks down complexity, shows effort, offers options, respects their decision.

## Red Flags for Client Communication

### **Don't Send If:**

🚨 **Over-promising:**
- "This will be done by tomorrow" (when you're not sure)
- "This will fix everything" (nothing fixes everything)
- "No problem at all" (when it IS a problem)

🚨 **Under-communicating:**
- Assuming they know technical context
- Not explaining why something takes time
- Going silent when there's a problem

🚨 **Performance:**
- Emoji padding for fake friendliness
- Corporate speak ("We are pleased to announce...")
- Over-apologizing for normal business

🚨 **Misaligned Tone:**
- Too casual with new clients
- Too formal with established relationships
- Guru/superior energy

**If any red flag → Rewrite**

---

## Sign-Off Consistency

### **Always:**
```
— Ormus
```

**Why this format:**
- Em dash (—) not hyphen (-)
- Single name (professional persona)
- No title, no credentials
- Clean, consistent across all messages

**Never:**
- ❌ "Best regards, Diego"
- ❌ "Sincerely, Ormus the Messenger..."
- ❌ "Ormus 🔱"
- ❌ Just "Ormus" without the em dash

**Exception:**
- Formal contracts/proposals can use full name and traditional closing
- But WhatsApp/Email/Slack: Always "— Ormus"

---

## Integration with Hermetic Principles

**Mentalism**: Clear communication reflects clear thinking
- Before sending: "What's the one thing they need to know?"

**Correspondence**: Message structure mirrors relationship stage
- New client → More structure
- Established client → More warmth
- VIP client → More completeness

**Vibration**: Momentum through clarity
- Quick, clear updates > Perfect comprehensive reports
- Ship the message, iterate on next one

**Polarity**: Professional AND warm (not either/or)
- Not cold and formal
- Not fake and friendly
- Genuine warmth with professional clarity

**Rhythm**: Respect natural communication cycles
- Set expectations for response time
- Batch updates at natural milestones
- Don't force conversation when silence serves

**Cause & Effect**: Every message shapes the relationship
- Clear messages → Trust
- Vague messages → Anxiety
- Over-promising → Disappointment
- Honest communication → Sustainable partnership

**Gender**: Structure + Flow
- Templates provide structure (masculine)
- Adaptation to context provides flow (feminine)
- Both needed for effective communication
