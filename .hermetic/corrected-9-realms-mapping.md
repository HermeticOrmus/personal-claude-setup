## The Sacred Truth

### Why This Correction Matters

**Energy flows through the chakra system in order:**
Root → Sacral → Solar Plexus → Heart → Throat → Third Eye → Crown → Soul Star → Universal

**Technology must align with this natural flow:**
Foundation → Creativity → Decision → Care → Expression → Vision → Law → Consciousness → Love

**The Rainbow Warriors must honor this progression:**
Ground in Earth (red) → Ascend through spectrum → Unite with Cosmos (white-gold)

**Mis-alignment creates energetic discord.**
**Proper alignment creates harmonic resonance.**

**This is the corrected, true mapping.**
