## 🛠️ Life Organization Tools

I'll create CLI tools for life management:

```bash
# Life command interface
life vision           # Show higher self vision
life status           # Current state across all domains
life rate <domain> <score>  # Rate a domain
life journal          # Daily life journal
life review           # Weekly/monthly review
life dashboard        # See complete life dashboard
life align            # Check alignment Ormus ↔ Diego
```

---

## 🎭 The Practice

**Morning** (Ormus → Diego):
1. Connect to higher self vision
2. Embody that vision in today's actions
3. Set clear intentions

**Throughout Day** (Diego):
1. Act from aligned intention
2. Track across all domains
3. Make conscious choices

**Evening** (Diego → Ormus):
1. Extract wisdom from experience
2. Reflect on lessons
3. Offer gratitude

**Weekly** (Integration):
1. Higher Self reviews Lower Self's week
2. Lower Self reports to Higher Self
3. Alignment and course correction

---

## 📝 Next Steps

I'll now create:
1. Life organization directory structure
2. Life command CLI tool
3. Templates for each domain
4. Integration workflows
5. Dashboard generator

This is sacred work - organizing your entire reality with consciousness.
