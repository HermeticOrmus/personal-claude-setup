# Hermetic Quick Start - The Essential 20%

> You don't need all 103 agents on day one. Start here.

## The Core Question

Before every technical decision, ask:

**"Does this empower users, or extract from them?"**

That's the entire philosophy in one sentence. Everything else is implementation details.

---

## The 3 Essential Principles (Start Here)

You have 7 Hermetic Principles. These 3 give you 80% of the value:

### 1. **Vibration** - "Ship It"
- Working imperfectly > perfect on paper
- 6-day cycles: build → ship → learn → repeat
- Real-world feedback beats theoretical perfection

**In practice:** Don't polish for weeks. Ship in days, learn from reality, iterate.

---

### 2. **Cause-Effect** - "Think Downstream"
- Every feature has consequences
- No "neutral" design choices
- Ask: "What happens if this succeeds wildly?"

**In practice:** Before building, trace the effects. If your feature works TOO well, what breaks? What behavior does it encourage?

---

### 3. **Rhythm** - "Pace Yourself"
- Sustainable pace > heroic sprints
- Rest is productive (integration happens during rest)
- 6 days work, 1 day integration

**In practice:** If you're burning out, you're doing it wrong. Quality emerges from sustainable rhythm.

## The 5 Essential Commands

You have 18 ceremonial commands. These 5 handle 90% of situations:

### `/gnosis` - Understand Deeply
**Use when:** Starting something new or complex
**Does:** Deep analysis before action (Mentalism principle)
**Example:** `/gnosis "authentication system requirements"`

### `/align` - Check Ethics
**Use when:** Unsure if request aligns with Gold Hat values
**Does:** Evaluates against empowerment vs extraction
**Example:** `/align "infinite scroll feature"`

### `/verify` - Prove Correctness
**Use when:** Before shipping anything important
**Does:** Tests, builds, validates functionality
**Example:** `/verify "payment processing flow"`

### `/dev-docs` - Preserve Context
**Use when:** Starting multi-session work (>2 hours)
**Does:** Creates plan/context/tasks files that survive compaction
**Example:** `/dev-docs` (after creating a plan)

### `/celebrate` - Mark Completion
**Use when:** You finish something (seriously, do this)
**Does:** Acknowledges completion, extracts learnings
**Example:** `/celebrate "shipped authentication v1"`

## The 3 Essential Agents (Your Go-To Specialists)

You have 103 agents. Start with these:

### `strategic-plan-architect`
**Use for:** Planning features before building
**Why:** Creates comprehensive plans with phases, risks, success criteria
**When:** Beginning any multi-day project

### `filesystem-organizer`
**Use for:** When your directories are chaos
**Why:** Creates structure that mirrors mental clarity (Correspondence)
**When:** Quarterly, or when you can't find anything

### `sacred-mirror-auditor`
**Use for:** Pre-launch quality checks
**Why:** Tests against all 9 realms (security, ethics, UX, etc.)
**When:** Before shipping anything to users

## The Essential Anti-Patterns (Never Build These)

These are extraction patterns disguised as features. Reject them:

❌ **Infinite scroll** - Addiction mechanic, disrespects time
✅ **Alternative:** Pagination with clear counts (user control)

❌ **Dark pattern unsubscribe** - Hidden, confusing opt-outs
✅ **Alternative:** One-click unsubscribe, same prominence as subscribe

❌ **Pre-checked data sharing** - Deceptive consent
✅ **Alternative:** Opt-in only, clear explanation

❌ **Notification spam** - Manufactured urgency
✅ **Alternative:** User-controlled notification preferences, defaulting to minimal

❌ **Fake scarcity** - "Only 2 left!" when there are 200
✅ **Alternative:** Real inventory counts, or no counts

**When a client/boss requests these:**
1. Explain the harm clearly
2. Offer empowering alternatives that still achieve business goals
3. If they insist, see "Economic Reality" section below

---

## The Daily Workflow

### Morning (5 min)
- Review yesterday's progress
- Identify today's 1-3 tasks
- Run `/gnosis` if starting something new

### During Work
- Ship imperfect, iterate fast (Vibration)
- Check alignment when uncertain (`/align`)
- Update dev docs if multi-session work

### Before Finishing (5 min)
- Run `/verify` on what you built
- Mark tasks complete
- Update dev docs with learnings

### Weekly (15 min)
- Run retrospective (see Measurement section)
- Celebrate completions (`/celebrate`)
- Archive finished projects
- Plan next week

## When to Go Deeper

You've started with the essentials. Go deeper when:

**You're learning a new skill:**
→ Explore Learning Master agents (Feynman, Tesla, Franklin)
→ Set up Learning directory structure

**You're making architectural decisions:**
→ Use `design-perfect-architecture` skill
→ Apply Mentalism + Correspondence + Polarity principles

**You face ethical dilemmas:**
→ Read Economic Reality section (below)
→ Use `/align` and `/illuminate` commands
→ Consult the full manifesto

**You're building complex features:**
→ Use full dev docs system (plan/context/tasks)
→ Engage specialized agents by domain
→ Apply all 7 Hermetic Principles

**You want to understand the philosophy:**
→ Read `.hermetic/manifesto.md` (complete Gold Hat philosophy)
→ Study `.hermetic/the-angelic-gauntlet.md` (9 Realms framework)
→ Explore `.hermetic/brand/` (how philosophy manifests visually)

## The 80/20 Summary

**Core belief:** Technology should empower, not extract.

**Core practice:** Ask "does this serve users?" before building anything.

**Core rhythm:** Ship in 6 days, rest on day 7, repeat.

**Core tools:** `/gnosis` (understand), `/align` (check ethics), `/verify` (prove quality), `/dev-docs` (preserve context), `/celebrate` (acknowledge completion)

**Core agents:** `strategic-plan-architect` (planning), `filesystem-organizer` (structure), `sacred-mirror-auditor` (quality)

**Core rejection:** Dark patterns, addiction mechanics, manipulation.

## Getting Started Right Now

1. **Read this document** (you're doing it)
2. **Try one command** - Run `/gnosis "what am I working on today?"`
3. **Apply one principle** - Before your next feature, ask "what are the downstream effects?" (Cause-Effect)
4. **Reject one anti-pattern** - Next time someone suggests infinite scroll, offer pagination instead
5. **Rest** - When you're tired, stop. Sustainable pace is the path.

**Welcome to conscious development.**

The full system is available when you need it. But these essentials will transform how you build.

Start here. Go deeper as needed. Build what elevates.
