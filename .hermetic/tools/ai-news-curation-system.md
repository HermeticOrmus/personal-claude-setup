# AI News Curation System
## Sacred Technology meets Information Hygiene

**WHY THIS EXISTS:**
The AI news cycle is engineered for FOMO, not wisdom. This automation filters signal from noise, empowerment from hype, truth from marketing.

---

## Philosophy: Hermetic Information Filters

### The Problem
**Current AI News Landscape:**
- 🔴 **Constant hype cycles** - "AGI by next Tuesday!"
- 🔴 **Vendor marketing disguised as news** - Press releases ≠ breakthroughs
- 🔴 **FOMO engineering** - "You're falling behind!"
- 🔴 **Technical jargon without context** - Buzzword soup
- 🔴 **Clickbait headlines** - Outrage & fear farming
- 🔴 **Echo chamber amplification** - Same story, 50 sources

**Result**: Anxiety, overwhelm, decision paralysis

### The Solution
**Hermetic Curation Principles:**

✅ **Signal > Noise** - Only genuine breakthroughs, not incremental updates
✅ **Context > Headlines** - "Why this matters" explanations
✅ **Empowerment > FOMO** - Educational framing, not panic
✅ **Truth > Hype** - Skeptical analysis of claims
✅ **Practical > Theoretical** - "What can I do with this?"
✅ **Calm > Urgency** - Daily digest, not constant alerts

## Hermetic Alignment Checklist

Before sending any news item, verify:

✅ **Does this empower the reader?**
   (Not just inform, but enable action)

✅ **Is this genuinely new?**
   (Not rehash of existing information)

✅ **Can I explain why it matters?**
   (Context provided, not just headline)

✅ **Is the source credible?**
   (Verifiable, not speculation)

✅ **Does this reduce anxiety or increase it?**
   (Calm framing, not FOMO)

✅ **Is this actionable or just interesting?**
   (Prefer actionable)

If ≥4 YES → Send
If ≤3 YES → Filter out

## Example Filtering Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Press Release
**Input**: "XYZ Corp announces revolutionary AI that will transform healthcare"

**Analysis**:
- Source: Press release (Low trust: 1)
- Keywords: "revolutionary", "will transform" (Hype signals)
- Evidence: None provided
- Actionability: Zero

**Decision**: FILTER OUT (Noise)

---

### Scenario 2: Research Paper
**Input**: ArXiv paper "Efficient Attention Mechanisms Reduce Training Costs by 60%"

**Analysis**:
- Source: ArXiv (High trust: 5)
- Keywords: "Efficient", specific metric (Good signals)

## Philosophy: Information as Sacred

**The Hermetic Approach to AI News:**

We live in an attention economy designed to extract your focus. Every headline competes for your anxiety, your FOMO, your click.

This automation is an act of **sacred resistance**.

By filtering with wisdom, by demanding substance over sensation, by choosing calm over chaos, you reclaim sovereignty over your information diet.

**The goal is not to "stay current."**
The goal is to build deep understanding of what actually moves the field forward.

Breadth creates anxiety.
Depth creates wisdom.

**Sacred Technology in Action** 🔱

*"As above (the signal), so below (the noise)"*
*Filter wisely. Learn deeply. Build powerfully.*
