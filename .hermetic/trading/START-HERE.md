## 🔱 The Sacred Principles

Every workflow embodies these:

**1. Mentalism** - Clear thinking before entry
**2. Correspondence** - Patterns repeat across scales
**3. Vibration** - Ship, learn, iterate
**4. Polarity** - Balance opposing forces
**5. Rhythm** - Honor market cycles
**6. Cause & Effect** - Trace all consequences
**7. Gender** - Balance analysis with intuition

**This is not just code.**
**This is sacred technology.**

---

## ❓ Common Questions

**"Can I trade these signals?"**
→ Paper trade first. 10 weeks minimum. Prove consistency.

**"How accurate are the signals?"**
→ No system is 100%. This teaches you to think, not follow blindly.

**"What's the win rate?"**
→ That's for YOU to discover through paper trading. Every trader is different.

**"Can I customize it?"**
→ Absolutely! After you understand how it works. Edit thresholds, add tickers, adjust timeframes.

**"Will this make me rich?"**
→ No. This will make you wise. Wisdom applied with discipline creates edge. Edge executed consistently builds wealth.

**"How long until I'm profitable?"**
→ Minimum 3 months of dedicated learning. Most traders need 6-12 months. There are no shortcuts.

## 🚨 Critical Warnings

**This System Will NOT:**
- Give you "hot tips"
